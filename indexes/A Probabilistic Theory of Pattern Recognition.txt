Pattern  recognition  presents  one  of the  most significant challenges
for scientists  and  engineers,  and  many  different approaches  have
been  proposed.  The  aim  of  this  book  is  to  provide  a self-contained
account of  probabilistic analysis  of these  approaches.  The  book
includes a discussion of distance measures, nonparametric methods
based on  kernels or nearest neighbors, Vapnik-Chervonenkis theo(cid:173)
ry,  epsilon  entropy,  parametric classification,  error estimation,  tree
classifiers,  and neural networks.
Wherever  possible,  distribution-free properties  and  inequalities are
derived.  A substantial  portion  of the  results  or the  analysis  is  new.
Over 430 problems and exercises complement the  material.
