Preface

The term machine learning refers to the automated detection of meaningful
patterns in data. In the past couple of decades it has become a common tool in
almost any task that requires information extraction from large data sets. We are
surrounded by a machine learning based technology: search engines learn how
to bring us the best results (while placing proﬁtable ads), anti-spam software
learns to ﬁlter our email messages, and credit card transactions are secured by
a software that learns how to detect frauds. Digital cameras learn to detect
faces and intelligent personal assistance applications on smart-phones learn to
recognize voice commands. Cars are equipped with accident prevention systems
that are built using machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is also widely
used in scientiﬁc applications such as bioinformatics, medicine, and astronomy.
One common feature of all of these applications is that, in contrast to more
traditional uses of computers, in these cases, due to the complexity of the patterns
that need to be detected, a human programmer cannot provide an explicit, ﬁne-
detailed speciﬁcation of how such tasks should be executed. Taking example from
intelligent beings, many of our skills are acquired or reﬁned through learning from
our experience (rather than following explicit instructions given to us). Machine
learning tools are concerned with endowing programs with the ability to “learn”
and adapt.

The ﬁrst goal of this book is to provide a rigorous, yet easy to follow, intro-
duction to the main concepts underlying machine learning: What is learning?
How can a machine learn? How do we quantify the resources needed to learn a
given concept? Is learning always possible? Can we know if the learning process
succeeded or failed?

The second goal of this book is to present several key machine learning algo-
rithms. We chose to present algorithms that on one hand are successfully used
in practice and on the other hand give a wide spectrum of diﬀerent learning
techniques. Additionally, we pay speciﬁc attention to algorithms appropriate for
large scale learning (a.k.a. “Big Data”), since in recent years, our world has be-
come increasingly “digitized” and the amount of data available for learning is
dramatically increasing. As a result, in many applications data is plentiful and
computation time is the main bottleneck. We therefore explicitly quantify both
the amount of data and the amount of computation time needed to learn a given
concept.

The book is divided into four parts. The ﬁrst part aims at giving an initial
rigorous answer to the fundamental questions of learning. We describe a gen-
eralization of Valiant’s Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model,
which is a ﬁrst solid answer to the question “what is learning?”. We describe
the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), Structural Risk Minimization (SRM),
and Minimum Description Length (MDL) learning rules, which shows “how can
a machine learn”. We quantify the amount of data needed for learning using
the ERM, SRM, and MDL rules and show how learning might fail by deriving

viii

a “no-free-lunch” theorem. We also discuss how much computation time is re-
quired for learning. In the second part of the book we describe various learning
algorithms. For some of the algorithms, we ﬁrst present a more general learning
principle, and then show how the algorithm follows the principle. While the ﬁrst
two parts of the book focus on the PAC model, the third part extends the scope
by presenting a wider variety of learning models. Finally, the last part of the
book is devoted to advanced theory.

We made an attempt to keep the book as self-contained as possible. However,
the reader is assumed to be comfortable with basic notions of probability, linear
algebra, analysis, and algorithms. The ﬁrst three parts of the book are intended
for ﬁrst year graduate students in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or
statistics. It can also be accessible to undergraduate students with the adequate
background. The more advanced chapters can be used by researchers intending
to gather a deeper theoretical understanding.

Acknowledgements

The book is based on Introduction to Machine Learning courses taught by Shai
Shalev-Shwartz at the Hebrew University and by Shai Ben-David at the Univer-
sity of Waterloo. The ﬁrst draft of the book grew out of the lecture notes for
the course that was taught at the Hebrew University by Shai Shalev-Shwartz
during 2010–2013. We greatly appreciate the help of Ohad Shamir, who served
as a TA for the course in 2010, and of Alon Gonen, who served as a TA for the
course in 2011–2013. Ohad and Alon prepared few lecture notes and many of
the exercises. Alon, to whom we are indebted for his help throughout the entire
making of the book, has also prepared a solution manual.

We are deeply grateful for the most valuable work of Dana Rubinstein. Dana
has scientiﬁcally proofread and edited the manuscript, transforming it from
lecture-based chapters into ﬂuent and coherent text.

Special thanks to Amit Daniely, who helped us with a careful read of the
advanced part of the book and also wrote the advanced chapter on multiclass
learnability. We are also grateful for the members of a book reading club in
Jerusalem that have carefully read and constructively criticized every line of
the manuscript. The members of the reading club are: Maya Alroy, Yossi Arje-
vani, Aharon Birnbaum, Alon Cohen, Alon Gonen, Roi Livni, Ofer Meshi, Dan
Rosenbaum, Dana Rubinstein, Shahar Somin, Alon Vinnikov, and Yoav Wald.
We would also like to thank Gal Elidan, Amir Globerson, Nika Haghtalab, Shie
Mannor, Amnon Shashua, Nati Srebro, and Ruth Urner for helpful discussions.

Introduction

The subject of this book is automated learning, or, as we will more often call
it, Machine Learning (ML). That is, we wish to program computers so that
they can “learn” from input available to them. Roughly speaking, learning is
the process of converting experience into expertise or knowledge. The input to
a learning algorithm is training data, representing experience, and the output
is some expertise, which usually takes the form of another computer program
that can perform some task. Seeking a formal-mathematical understanding of
this concept, we’ll have to be more explicit about what we mean by each of the
involved terms: What is the training data our programs will access? How can
the process of learning be automated? How can we evaluate the success of such
a process (namely, the quality of the output of a learning program)?

1.1

What Is Learning?

Let us begin by considering a couple of examples from naturally occurring ani-
mal learning. Some of the most fundamental issues in ML arise already in that
context, which we are all familiar with.

Bait Shyness – Rats Learning to Avoid Poisonous Baits: When rats encounter
food items with novel look or smell, they will ﬁrst eat very small amounts, and
subsequent feeding will depend on the ﬂavor of the food and its physiological
eﬀect. If the food produces an ill eﬀect, the novel food will often be associated
with the illness, and subsequently, the rats will not eat it. Clearly, there is a
learning mechanism in play here – the animal used past experience with some
food to acquire expertise in detecting the safety of this food. If past experience
with the food was negatively labeled, the animal predicts that it will also have
a negative eﬀect when encountered in the future.

Inspired by the preceding example of successful learning, let us demonstrate a
typical machine learning task. Suppose we would like to program a machine that
learns how to ﬁlter spam e-mails. A naive solution would be seemingly similar
to the way rats learn how to avoid poisonous baits. The machine will simply
memorize all previous e-mails that had been labeled as spam e-mails by the
human user. When a new e-mail arrives, the machine will search for it in the set

Introduction

of previous spam e-mails. If it matches one of them, it will be trashed. Otherwise,
it will be moved to the user’s inbox folder.

While the preceding “learning by memorization” approach is sometimes use-
ful, it lacks an important aspect of learning systems – the ability to label unseen
e-mail messages. A successful learner should be able to progress from individual
examples to broader generalization. This is also referred to as inductive reasoning
or inductive inference. In the bait shyness example presented previously, after
the rats encounter an example of a certain type of food, they apply their attitude
toward it on new, unseen examples of food of similar smell and taste. To achieve
generalization in the spam ﬁltering task, the learner can scan the previously seen
e-mails, and extract a set of words whose appearance in an e-mail message is
indicative of spam. Then, when a new e-mail arrives, the machine can check
whether one of the suspicious words appears in it, and predict its label accord-
ingly. Such a system would potentially be able correctly to predict the label of
unseen e-mails.

However, inductive reasoning might lead us to false conclusions. To illustrate

this, let us consider again an example from animal learning.

Pigeon Superstition: In an experiment performed by the psychologist B. F. Skinner,

he placed a bunch of hungry pigeons in a cage. An automatic mechanism had
been attached to the cage, delivering food to the pigeons at regular intervals
with no reference whatsoever to the birds’ behavior. The hungry pigeons went
around the cage, and when food was ﬁrst delivered, it found each pigeon engaged
in some activity (pecking, turning the head, etc.). The arrival of food reinforced
each bird’s speciﬁc action, and consequently, each bird tended to spend some
more time doing that very same action. That, in turn, increased the chance that
the next random food delivery would ﬁnd each bird engaged in that activity
again. What results is a chain of events that reinforces the pigeons’ association
of the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been perform-
ing when it was ﬁrst delivered. They subsequently continue to perform these
same actions diligently.1

What distinguishes learning mechanisms that result in superstition from useful
learning? This question is crucial to the development of automated learners.
While human learners can rely on common sense to ﬁlter out random meaningless
learning conclusions, once we export the task of learning to a machine, we must
provide well deﬁned crisp principles that will protect the program from reaching
senseless or useless conclusions. The development of such principles is a central
goal of the theory of machine learning.

What, then, made the rats’ learning more successful than that of the pigeons?
As a ﬁrst step toward answering this question, let us have a closer look at the
bait shyness phenomenon in rats.

Bait Shyness revisited – rats fail to acquire conditioning between food and
electric shock or between sound and nausea: The bait shyness mechanism in

rats turns out to be more complex than what one may expect. In experiments
carried out by Garcia (Garcia & Koelling 1996), it was demonstrated that if the
unpleasant stimulus that follows food consumption is replaced by, say, electrical
shock (rather than nausea), then no conditioning occurs. Even after repeated
trials in which the consumption of some food is followed by the administration of
unpleasant electrical shock, the rats do not tend to avoid that food. Similar failure
of conditioning occurs when the characteristic of the food that implies nausea
(such as taste or smell) is replaced by a vocal signal. The rats seem to have
some “built in” prior knowledge telling them that, while temporal correlation
between food and nausea can be causal, it is unlikely that there would be a
causal relationship between food consumption and electrical shocks or between
sounds and nausea.

We conclude that one distinguishing feature between the bait shyness learning
and the pigeon superstition is the incorporation of prior knowledge that biases
the learning mechanism. This is also referred to as inductive bias. The pigeons in
the experiment are willing to adopt any explanation for the occurrence of food.
However, the rats “know” that food cannot cause an electric shock and that the
co-occurrence of noise with some food is not likely to aﬀect the nutritional value
of that food. The rats’ learning process is biased toward detecting some kind of
patterns while ignoring other temporal correlations between events.

It turns out that the incorporation of prior knowledge, biasing the learning
process, is inevitable for the success of learning algorithms (this is formally stated
and proved as the “No-Free-Lunch theorem” in Chapter 5). The development of
tools for expressing domain expertise, translating it into a learning bias, and
quantifying the eﬀect of such a bias on the success of learning is a central theme
of the theory of machine learning. Roughly speaking, the stronger the prior
knowledge (or prior assumptions) that one starts the learning process with, the
easier it is to learn from further examples. However, the stronger these prior
assumptions are, the less ﬂexible the learning is – it is bound, a priori, by the
commitment to these assumptions. We shall discuss these issues explicitly in
Chapter 5.

1.2

When Do We Need Machine Learning?

When do we need machine learning rather than directly program our computers
to carry out the task at hand? Two aspects of a given problem may call for the
use of programs that learn and improve on the basis of their “experience”: the
problem’s complexity and the need for adaptivity.

Tasks That Are Too Complex to Program.

• Tasks Performed by Animals/Humans: There are numerous tasks that
we human beings perform routinely, yet our introspection concern-
ing how we do them is not suﬃciently elaborate to extract a well

22

Introduction

deﬁned program. Examples of such tasks include driving, speech
recognition, and image understanding. In all of these tasks, state
of the art machine learning programs, programs that “learn from
their experience,” achieve quite satisfactory results, once exposed
to suﬃciently many training examples.

• Tasks beyond Human Capabilities: Another wide family of tasks that
beneﬁt from machine learning techniques are related to the analy-
sis of very large and complex data sets: astronomical data, turning
medical archives into medical knowledge, weather prediction, anal-
ysis of genomic data, Web search engines, and electronic commerce.
With more and more available digitally recorded data, it becomes
obvious that there are treasures of meaningful information buried
in data archives that are way too large and too complex for humans
to make sense of. Learning to detect meaningful patterns in large
and complex data sets is a promising domain in which the combi-
nation of programs that learn with the almost unlimited memory
capacity and ever increasing processing speed of computers opens
up new horizons.

Adaptivity. One limiting feature of programmed tools is their rigidity – once
the program has been written down and installed, it stays unchanged.
However, many tasks change over time or from one user to another.
Machine learning tools – programs whose behavior adapts to their input
data – oﬀer a solution to such issues; they are, by nature, adaptive
to changes in the environment they interact with. Typical successful
applications of machine learning to such problems include programs that
decode handwritten text, where a ﬁxed program can adapt to variations
between the handwriting of diﬀerent users; spam detection programs,
adapting automatically to changes in the nature of spam e-mails; and
speech recognition programs.

1.3

Types of Learning

Learning is, of course, a very wide domain. Consequently, the ﬁeld of machine
learning has branched into several subﬁelds dealing with diﬀerent types of learn-
ing tasks. We give a rough taxonomy of learning paradigms, aiming to provide
some perspective of where the content of this book sits within the wide ﬁeld of
machine learning.

We describe four parameters along which learning paradigms can be classiﬁed.

Supervised versus Unsupervised Since learning involves an interaction be-
tween the learner and the environment, one can divide learning tasks
according to the nature of that interaction. The ﬁrst distinction to note
is the diﬀerence between supervised and unsupervised learning. As an

1.3 Types of Learning

23

illustrative example, consider the task of learning to detect spam e-mail
versus the task of anomaly detection. For the spam detection task, we
consider a setting in which the learner receives training e-mails for which
the label spam/not-spam is provided. On the basis of such training the
learner should ﬁgure out a rule for labeling a newly arriving e-mail mes-
sage. In contrast, for the task of anomaly detection, all the learner gets
as training is a large body of e-mail messages (with no labels) and the
learner’s task is to detect “unusual” messages.

More abstractly, viewing learning as a process of “using experience
to gain expertise,” supervised learning describes a scenario in which the
“experience,” a training example, contains signiﬁcant information (say,
the spam/not-spam labels) that is missing in the unseen “test examples”
to which the learned expertise is to be applied. In this setting, the ac-
quired expertise is aimed to predict that missing information for the test
data. In such cases, we can think of the environment as a teacher that
“supervises” the learner by providing the extra information (labels). In
unsupervised learning, however, there is no distinction between training
and test data. The learner processes input data with the goal of coming
up with some summary, or compressed version of that data. Clustering
a data set into subsets of similar objets is a typical example of such a
task.

There is also an intermediate learning setting in which, while the
training examples contain more information than the test examples, the
learner is required to predict even more information for the test exam-
ples. For example, one may try to learn a value function that describes for
each setting of a chess board the degree by which White’s position is bet-
ter than the Black’s. Yet, the only information available to the learner at
training time is positions that occurred throughout actual chess games,
labeled by who eventually won that game. Such learning frameworks are
mainly investigated under the title of reinforcement learning.

Active versus Passive Learners Learning paradigms can vary by the role
played by the learner. We distinguish between “active” and “passive”
learners. An active learner interacts with the environment at training
time, say, by posing queries or performing experiments, while a passive
learner only observes the information provided by the environment (or
the teacher) without inﬂuencing or directing it. Note that the learner of a
spam ﬁlter is usually passive – waiting for users to mark the e-mails com-
ing to them. In an active setting, one could imagine asking users to label
speciﬁc e-mails chosen by the learner, or even composed by the learner, to
enhance
what
spam is.

of

Helpfulness of the Teacher When one thinks about human learning, of a
baby at home or a student at school, the process often involves a helpful
teacher, who is trying to feed the learner with the information most use-

24

Introduction

ful for achieving the learning goal. In contrast, when a scientist learns
about nature, the environment, playing the role of the teacher, can be
best thought of as passive – apples drop, stars shine, and the rain falls
without regard to the needs of the learner. We model such learning sce-
narios by postulating that the training data (or the learner’s experience)
is generated by some random process. This is the basic building block in
the branch of “statistical learning.” Finally, learning also occurs when
the learner’s input is generated by an adversarial “teacher.” This may be
the case in the spam ﬁltering example (if the spammer makes an eﬀort
to mislead the spam ﬁltering designer) or in learning to detect fraud.
One also uses an adversarial teacher model as a worst-case scenario,
when no milder setup can be safely assumed. If you can learn against an
adversarial teacher, you are guaranteed to succeed interacting any odd
teacher.

Online versus Batch Learning Protocol The last parameter we mention is
the distinction between situations in which the learner has to respond
online, throughout the learning process, and settings in which the learner
has to engage the acquired expertise only after having a chance to process
large amounts of data. For example, a stockbroker has to make daily
decisions, based on the experience collected so far. He may become an
expert over time, but might have made costly mistakes in the process. In
contrast, in many data mining settings, the learner – the data miner –
has large amounts of training data to play with before having to output
conclusions.

In this book we shall discuss only a subset of the possible learning paradigms.
Our main focus is on supervised statistical batch learning with a passive learner
(for example, trying to learn how to generate patients’ prognoses, based on large
archives of records of patients that were independently collected and are already
labeled by the fate of the recorded patients). We shall also brieﬂy discuss online
learning and batch unsupervised learning (in particular, clustering).

1.4

Relations to Other Fields

As an interdisciplinary ﬁeld, machine learning shares common threads with the
mathematical ﬁelds of statistics, information theory, game theory, and optimiza-
tion. It is naturally a subﬁeld of computer science, as our goal is to program
machines so that they will learn. In a sense, machine learning can be viewed as
a branch of AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence), since, after all, the ability to turn expe-
rience into expertise or to detect meaningful patterns in complex sensory data
is a cornerstone of human (and animal) intelligence. However, one should note
that, in contrast with traditional AI, machine learning is not trying to build
automated imitation of intelligent behavior, but rather to use the strengths and

1.5 How to Read This Book

25

special abilities of computers to complement human intelligence, often perform-
ing tasks that fall way beyond human capabilities. For example, the ability to
scan and process huge databases allows machine learning programs to detect
patterns that are outside the scope of human perception.

The component of experience, or training, in machine learning often refers
to data that is randomly generated. The task of the learner is to process such
randomly generated examples toward drawing conclusions that hold for the en-
vironment from which these examples are picked. This description of machine
learning highlights its close relationship with statistics. Indeed there is a lot in
common between the two disciplines, in terms of both the goals and techniques
used. There are, however, a few signiﬁcant diﬀerences of emphasis; if a doctor
comes up with the hypothesis that there is a correlation between smoking and
heart disease, it is the statistician’s role to view samples of patients and check
the validity of that hypothesis (this is the common statistical task of hypothe-
sis testing). In contrast, machine learning aims to use the data gathered from
samples of patients to come up with a description of the causes of heart disease.
The hope is that automated techniques may be able to ﬁgure out meaningful
patterns (or hypotheses) that may have been missed by the human observer.

In contrast with traditional statistics, in machine learning in general, and
in this book in particular, algorithmic considerations play a major role. Ma-
chine learning is about the execution of learning by computers; hence algorith-
mic issues are pivotal. We develop algorithms to perform the learning tasks and
are concerned with their computational eﬃciency. Another diﬀerence is that
while statistics is often interested in asymptotic behavior (like the convergence
of sample-based statistical estimates as the sample sizes grow to inﬁnity), the
theory of machine learning focuses on ﬁnite sample bounds. Namely, given the
size of available samples, machine learning theory aims to ﬁgure out the degree
of accuracy that a learner can expect on the basis of such samples.

There are further diﬀerences between these two disciplines, of which we shall
mention only one more here. While in statistics it is common to work under the
assumption of certain presubscribed data models (such as assuming the normal-
ity of data-generating distributions, or the linearity of functional dependencies),
in machine learning the emphasis is on working under a “distribution-free” set-
ting, where the learner assumes as little as possible about the nature of the
data distribution and allows the learning algorithm to ﬁgure out which models
best approximate the data-generating process. A precise discussion of this issue
requires some technical preliminaries, and we will come back to it later in the
book, and in particular in Chapter 5.

How to Read This Book

The ﬁrst part of the book provides the basic theoretical principles that underlie
machine learning (ML). In a sense, this is the foundation upon which the rest

26

Introduction

of the book is built. This part could serve as a basis for a minicourse on the
theoretical foundations of ML.

The second part of the book introduces the most commonly used algorithmic
approaches to supervised machine learning. A subset of these chapters may also
be used for introducing machine learning in a general AI course to computer
science, Math, or engineering students.

The third part of the book extends the scope of discussion from statistical
classiﬁcation to other learning models. It covers online learning, unsupervised
learning, dimensionality reduction, generative models, and feature learning.

The fourth part of the book, Advanced Theory, is geared toward readers who
have interest in research and provides the more technical mathematical tech-
niques that serve to analyze and drive forward the ﬁeld of theoretical machine
learning.

The Appendixes provide some technical tools used in the book. In particular,

we list basic results from measure concentration and linear algebra.

A few sections are marked by an asterisk, which means they are addressed to
more advanced students. Each chapter is concluded with a list of exercises. A
solution manual is provided in the course Web site.

Notation

Most of the notation we use throughout the book is either standard or deﬁned
on the spot. In this section we describe our main conventions and provide a
table summarizing our notation (Table 1.1). The reader is encouraged to skip
this section and return to it if during the reading of the book some notation is
unclear.

We denote scalars and abstract objects with lowercase letters (e.g. x and λ).
Often, we would like to emphasize that some object is a vector and then we
use boldface letters (e.g. x and λ). The ith element of a vector x is denoted
by xi. We use uppercase letters to denote matrices, sets, and sequences. The
meaning should be clear from the context. As we will see momentarily, the input
of a learning algorithm is a sequence of training examples. We denote by z an
abstract example and by S = z1, . . . , zm a sequence of m examples. Historically,
S is often referred to as a training set; however, we will always assume that S is
a sequence rather than a set. A sequence of m vectors is denoted by x1, . . . , xm.
The ith element of xt is denoted by xt,i.
Throughout the book, we make use of basic notions from probability. We
denote by D a distribution over some set,2 for example, Z. We use the notation
z ∼ D to denote that z is sampled according to D. Given a random variable
f : Z → R, its expected value is denoted by Ez∼D[f (z)]. We sometimes use the
shorthand E[f ] when the dependence on z is clear from the context. For f : Z →
{true, false} we also use Pz∼D[f (z)] to denote D({z : f (z) = true}). In the
next chapter we will also introduce the notation Dm to denote the probability
over Z m induced by sampling (z1, . . . , zm) where each point zi is sampled from
D independently of the other points.
In general, we have made an eﬀort to avoid asymptotic notation. However, we
occasionally use it to clarify the main results. In particular, given f : R → R+
and g : R → R+ we write f = O(g) if there exist x0, α ∈ R+ such that for all
x > x0 we have f (x) ≤ αg(x). We write f = o(g) if for every α > 0 there exists
2 To be mathematically precise, D should be deﬁned over some σ-algebra of subsets of Z.

The user who is not familiar with measure theory can skip the few footnotes and remarks
regarding more formal measurability deﬁnitions and assumptions.

exist x0, α ∈ R+ such that for all x > x0 we have f (x) ≥ αg(x). The notation
f = ω(g) is deﬁned analogously. The notation f = Θ(g) means that f = O(g)

We use the notation minx∈C f (x) to denote the minimum value of the set
{f (x) : x ∈ C}. To be mathematically more precise, we should use inf x∈C f (x)
whenever the minimum is not achievable. However, in the context of this book
the distinction between inﬁmum and minimum is often of little interest. Hence,
to simplify the presentation, we sometimes use the min notation even when inf
is more adequate. An analogous remark applies to max versus sup.

A Gentle Start

Let us begin our mathematical analysis by showing how successful learning can be
achieved in a relatively simpliﬁed setting. Imagine you have just arrived in some
small Paciﬁc island. You soon ﬁnd out that papayas are a signiﬁcant ingredient
in the local diet. However, you have never before tasted papayas. You have to
learn how to predict whether a papaya you see in the market is tasty or not.
First, you need to decide which features of a papaya your prediction should be
based on. On the basis of your previous experience with other fruits, you decide
to use two features: the papaya’s color, ranging from dark green, through orange
and red to dark brown, and the papaya’s softness, ranging from rock hard to
mushy. Your input for ﬁguring out your prediction rule is a sample of papayas
that you have examined for color and softness and then tasted and found out
whether they were tasty or not. Let us analyze this task as a demonstration of
the considerations involved in learning problems.

Our ﬁrst step is to describe a formal model aimed to capture such learning

tasks.

2.1

A Formal Model – The Statistical Learning Framework

• The learner’s input: In the basic statistical learning setting, the learner has

access to the following:
– Domain set: An arbitrary set, X . This is the set of objects that we
may wish to label. For example, in the papaya learning problem men-
tioned before, the domain set will be the set of all papayas. Usually,
these domain points will be represented by a vector of features (like
the papaya’s color and softness). We also refer to domain points as
instances and to X as instance space.

– Label set: For our current discussion, we will restrict the label set to
be a two-element set, usually {0, 1} or {−1, +1}. Let Y denote our
set of possible labels. For our papayas example, let Y be {0, 1}, where
1 represents being tasty and 0 stands for being not-tasty.

– Training data: S = ((x1, y1) . . . (xm, ym)) is a ﬁnite sequence of pairs in
X ×Y: that is, a sequence of labeled domain points. This is the input

tasted and their color, softness, and tastiness). Such labeled examples
are often called training examples. We sometimes also refer to S as a
training set.1

• The learner’s output: The learner is requested to output a prediction rule,
h : X → Y. This function is also called a predictor, a hypothesis, or a clas-
siﬁer. The predictor can be used to predict the label of new domain points.
In our papayas example, it is a rule that our learner will employ to predict
whether future papayas he examines in the farmers’ market are going to
be tasty or not. We use the notation A(S) to denote the hypothesis that a
learning algorithm, A, returns upon receiving the training sequence S.

• A simple data-generation model We now explain how the training data is
generated. First, we assume that the instances (the papayas we encounter)
are generated by some probability distribution (in this case, representing
the environment). Let us denote that probability distribution over X by
D. It is important to note that we do not assume that the learner knows
anything about this distribution. For the type of learning tasks we discuss,
this could be any arbitrary probability distribution. As to the labels, in the
current discussion we assume that there is some “correct” labeling function,
f : X → Y, and that yi = f (xi) for all i. This assumption will be relaxed in
the next chapter. The labeling function is unknown to the learner. In fact,
this is just what the learner is trying to ﬁgure out. In summary, each pair
in the training data S is generated by ﬁrst sampling a point xi according
to D and then labeling it by f .
• Measures of success: We deﬁne the error of a classiﬁer to be the probability
that it does not predict the correct label on a random data point generated
by the aforementioned underlying distribution. That is, the error of h is
the probability to draw a random instance x, according to the distribution
D, such that h(x) does not equal f (x).

Formally, given a domain subset,2 A ⊂ X , the probability distribution,
D, assigns a number, D(A), which determines how likely it is to observe a
point x ∈ A. In many cases, we refer to A as an event and express it using
a function π : X → {0, 1}, namely, A = {x ∈ X : π(x) = 1}. In that case,
we also use the notation Px∼D[π(x)] to express D(A).

We deﬁne the error of a prediction rule, h : X → Y, to be
x∼D[h(x) (cid:54)= f (x)] def= D({x : h(x) (cid:54)= f (x)}).
LD,f (h) def= P

(2.1)

That is, the error of such h is the probability of randomly choosing an
example x for which h(x) (cid:54)= f (x). The subscript (D, f ) indicates that the
error is measured with respect to the probability distribution D and the

correct labeling function f . We omit this subscript when it is clear from
the context. L(D,f )(h) has several synonymous names such as the general-
ization error, the risk, or the true error of h, and we will use these names
interchangeably throughout the book. We use the letter L for the error,
since we view this error as the loss of the learner. We will later also discuss
other possible formulations of such loss.

• A note about the information available to the learner The learner is
blind to the underlying distribution D over the world and to the labeling
function f. In our papayas example, we have just arrived in a new island
and we have no clue as to how papayas are distributed and how to predict
their tastiness. The only way the learner can interact with the environment
is through observing the training set.

In the next section we describe a simple learning paradigm for the preceding

setup and analyze its performance.

2.2

Empirical Risk Minimization

As mentioned earlier, a learning algorithm receives as input a training set S,
sampled from an unknown distribution D and labeled by some target function
f , and should output a predictor hS : X → Y (the subscript S emphasizes the
fact that the output predictor depends on S). The goal of the algorithm is to
ﬁnd hS that minimizes the error with respect to the unknown D and f .

Since the learner does not know what D and f are, the true error is not directly
available to the learner. A useful notion of error that can be calculated by the
learner is the training error – the error the classiﬁer incurs over the training
sample:

,

(2.2)

LS(h) def=

where [m] = {1, . . . , m}.

|{i ∈ [m] : h(xi) (cid:54)= yi}|

m

The terms empirical error and empirical risk are often used interchangeably

for this error.

Since the training sample is the snapshot of the world that is available to the
learner, it makes sense to search for a solution that works well on that data.
This learning paradigm – coming up with a predictor h that minimizes LS(h) –
is called Empirical Risk Minimization or ERM for short.

2.2.1

Something May Go Wrong – Overﬁtting

Although the ERM rule seems very natural, without being careful, this approach
may fail miserably.

To demonstrate such a failure, let us go back to the problem of learning to

36

predict the taste of a papaya on the basis of its softness and color. Consider a
sample as depicted in the following:

Assume that the probability distribution D is such that instances are distributed
uniformly within the gray square and the labeling function, f , determines the
label to be 1 if the instance is within the inner blue square, and 0 otherwise. The
area of the gray square in the picture is 2 and the area of the blue square is 1.
Consider the following predictor:

if ∃i ∈ [m] s.t. xi = x
otherwise.

(2.3)

yi

(cid:40)

hS(x) =

While this predictor might seem rather artiﬁcial, in Exercise 1 we show a natural
representation of it using polynomials. Clearly, no matter what the sample is,
LS(hS) = 0, and therefore this predictor may be chosen by an ERM algorithm (it
is one of the empirical-minimum-cost hypotheses; no classiﬁer can have smaller
error). On the other hand, the true error of any classiﬁer that predicts the label
1 only on a ﬁnite number of instances is, in this case, 1/2. Thus, LD(hS) = 1/2.
We have found a predictor whose performance on the training set is excellent,
yet its performance on the true “world” is very poor. This phenomenon is called
overﬁtting. Intuitively, overﬁtting occurs when our hypothesis ﬁts the training
data “too well” (perhaps like the everyday experience that a person who provides
a perfect detailed explanation for each of his single actions may raise suspicion).

2.3

Empirical Risk Minimization with Inductive Bias

We have just demonstrated that the ERM rule might lead to overﬁtting. Rather
than giving up on the ERM paradigm, we will look for ways to rectify it. We will
search for conditions under which there is a guarantee that ERM does not overﬁt,
namely, conditions under which when the ERM predictor has good performance
with respect to the training data, it is also highly likely to perform well over the
underlying data distribution.

A common solution is to apply the ERM learning rule over a restricted search
space. Formally, the learner should choose in advance (before seeing the data) a
set of predictors. This set is called a hypothesis class and is denoted by H. Each
h ∈ H is a function mapping from X to Y. For a given class H, and a training
sample, S, the ERMH learner uses the ERM rule to choose a predictor h ∈ H,

2.3 Empirical Risk Minimization with Inductive Bias

37

with the lowest possible error over S. Formally,
ERMH(S) ∈ argmin
h∈H

LS(h),

where argmin stands for the set of hypotheses in H that achieve the minimum
value of LS(h) over H. By restricting the learner to choosing a predictor from
H, we bias it toward a particular set of predictors. Such restrictions are often
called an inductive bias. Since the choice of such a restriction is determined
before the learner sees the training data, it should ideally be based on some
prior knowledge about the problem to be learned. For example, for the papaya
taste prediction problem we may choose the class H to be the set of predictors
that are determined by axis aligned rectangles (in the space determined by the
color and softness coordinates). We will later show that ERMH over this class is
guaranteed not to overﬁt. On the other hand, the example of overﬁtting that we
have seen previously, demonstrates that choosing H to be a class of predictors
that includes all functions that assign the value 1 to a ﬁnite set of domain points
does not suﬃce to guarantee that ERMH will not overﬁt.

A fundamental question in learning theory is, over which hypothesis classes
ERMH learning will not result in overﬁtting. We will study this question later
in the book.

Intuitively, choosing a more restricted hypothesis class better protects us
against overﬁtting but at the same time might cause us a stronger inductive
bias. We will get back to this fundamental tradeoﬀ later.

2.3.1

Finite Hypothesis Classes

The simplest type of restriction on a class is imposing an upper bound on its size
(that is, the number of predictors h in H). In this section, we show that if H is
a ﬁnite class then ERMH will not overﬁt, provided it is based on a suﬃciently
large training sample (this size requirement will depend on the size of H).

Limiting the learner to prediction rules within some ﬁnite hypothesis class may
be considered as a reasonably mild restriction. For example, H can be the set of
all predictors that can be implemented by a C++ program written in at most
109 bits of code. In our papayas example, we mentioned previously the class of
axis aligned rectangles. While this is an inﬁnite class, if we discretize the repre-
sentation of real numbers, say, by using a 64 bits ﬂoating-point representation,
the hypothesis class becomes a ﬁnite class.

Let us now analyze the performance of the ERMH learning rule assuming that
H is a ﬁnite class. For a training sample, S, labeled according to some f : X → Y,
let hS denote a result of applying ERMH to S, namely,

hS ∈ argmin
h∈H

LS(h).

(2.4)

In this chapter, we make the following simplifying assumption (which will be

relaxed in the next chapter).

38

A Gentle Start

definition 2.1 (The Realizability Assumption) There exists h(cid:63) ∈ H s.t.
L(D,f )(h(cid:63)) = 0. Note that this assumption implies that with probability 1 over
random samples, S, where the instances of S are sampled according to D and
are labeled by f , we have LS(h(cid:63)) = 0.

The realizability assumption implies that for every ERM hypothesis we have
that3 LS(hS) = 0. However, we are interested in the true risk of hS, L(D,f )(hS),
rather than its empirical risk.

Clearly, any guarantee on the error with respect to the underlying distribution,
D, for an algorithm that has access only to a sample S should depend on the
relationship between D and S. The common assumption in statistical machine
learning is that the training sample S is generated by sampling points from the
distribution D independently of each other. Formally,
• The i.i.d. assumption: The examples in the training set are independently
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to the distribution D. That is,
every xi in S is freshly sampled according to D and then labeled according
to the labeling function, f . We denote this assumption by S ∼ Dm where
m is the size of S, and Dm denotes the probability over m-tuples induced
by applying D to pick each element of the tuple independently of the other
members of the tuple.

Intuitively, the training set S is a window through which the learner
gets partial information about the distribution D over the world and the
labeling function, f . The larger the sample gets, the more likely it is to
reﬂect more accurately the distribution and labeling used to generate it.

Since L(D,f )(hS) depends on the training set, S, and that training set is picked
by a random process, there is randomness in the choice of the predictor hS
and, consequently, in the risk L(D,f )(hS). Formally, we say that it is a random
variable. It is not realistic to expect that with full certainty S will suﬃce to
direct the learner toward a good classiﬁer (from the point of view of D), as
there is always some probability that the sampled training data happens to
be very nonrepresentative of the underlying D. If we go back to the papaya
tasting example, there is always some (small) chance that all the papayas we
have happened to taste were not tasty, in spite of the fact that, say, 70% of the
papayas in our island are tasty. In such a case, ERMH(S) may be the constant
function that labels every papaya as “not tasty” (and has 70% error on the true
distribution of papapyas in the island). We will therefore address the probability
to sample a training set for which L(D,f )(hS) is not too large. Usually, we denote
the probability of getting a nonrepresentative sample by δ, and call (1 − δ) the
conﬁdence parameter of our prediction.

On top of that, since we cannot guarantee perfect label prediction, we intro-
duce another parameter for the quality of prediction, the accuracy parameter,

3 Mathematically speaking, this holds with probability 1. To simplify the presentation, we

sometimes omit the “with probability 1” speciﬁer.

commonly denoted by . We interpret the event L(D,f )(hS) >  as a failure of the
learner, while if L(D,f )(hS) ≤  we view the output of the algorithm as an approx-
imately correct predictor. Therefore (ﬁxing some labeling function f : X → Y),
we are interested in upper bounding the probability to sample m-tuple of in-
stances that will lead to failure of the learner. Formally, let S|x = (x1, . . . , xm)
be the instances of the training set. We would like to upper bound

Dm({S|x : L(D,f )(hS) > }).

Let HB be the set of “bad” hypotheses, that is,

HB = {h ∈ H : L(D,f )(h) > }.

In addition, let

M = {S|x : ∃h ∈ HB, LS(h) = 0}

be the set of misleading samples: Namely, for every S|x ∈ M , there is a “bad”
hypothesis, h ∈ HB, that looks like a “good” hypothesis on S|x. Now, recall that
we would like to bound the probability of the event L(D,f )(hS) > . But, since
the realizability assumption implies that LS(hS) = 0, it follows that the event
L(D,f )(hS) >  can only happen if for some h ∈ HB we have LS(h) = 0. In
other words, this event will only happen if our sample is in the set of misleading
samples, M . Formally, we have shown that

{S|x : L(D,f )(hS) > } ⊆ M .

Note that we can rewrite M as

(cid:91)

h∈HB

M =

{S|x : LS(h) = 0}.

(2.5)

Hence,

Dm({S|x : L(D,f )(hS) > }) ≤ Dm(M ) = Dm(∪h∈HB{S|x : LS(h) = 0}).

(2.6)
Next, we upper bound the right-hand side of the preceding equation using the

union bound – a basic property of probabilities.
lemma 2.2 (Union Bound) For any two sets A, B and a distribution D we
have

D(A ∪ B) ≤ D(A) + D(B).

Applying the union bound to the right-hand side of Equation (2.6) yields

Dm({S|x : L(D,f )(hS) > }) ≤ (cid:88)

h∈HB

Dm({S|x : LS(h) = 0}).

(2.7)

Next, let us bound each summand of the right-hand side of the preceding in-
equality. Fix some “bad” hypothesis h ∈ HB. The event LS(h) = 0 is equivalent

40

A Gentle Start

to the event ∀i, h(xi) = f (xi). Since the examples in the training set are sampled
i.i.d. we get that

Dm({S|x : LS(h) = 0}) = Dm({S|x : ∀i, h(xi) = f (xi)})
D({xi : h(xi) = f (xi)}).

m(cid:89)

=

(2.8)

i=1

For each individual sampling of an element of the training set we have

D({xi : h(xi) = yi}) = 1 − L(D,f )(h) ≤ 1 − ,

where the last inequality follows from the fact that h ∈ HB. Combining the
previous equation with Equation (2.8) and using the inequality 1 −  ≤ e− we
obtain that for every h ∈ HB,

Dm({S|x : LS(h) = 0}) ≤ (1 − )m ≤ e−m.

(2.9)

Combining this equation with Equation (2.7) we conclude that

Dm({S|x : L(D,f )(hS) > }) ≤ |HB| e−m ≤ |H| e− m.

A graphical illustration which explains how we used the union bound is given in
Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1 Each point in the large circle represents a possible m-tuple of instances.
Each colored oval represents the set of “misleading” m-tuple of instances for some
“bad” predictor h ∈ HB. The ERM can potentially overﬁt whenever it gets a
misleading training set S. That is, for some h ∈ HB we have LS(h) = 0.
Equation (2.9) guarantees that for each individual bad hypothesis, h ∈ HB, at most
(1 − )m-fraction of the training sets would be misleading. In particular, the larger m
is, the smaller each of these colored ovals becomes. The union bound formalizes the
fact that the area representing the training sets that are misleading with respect to
some h ∈ HB (that is, the training sets in M ) is at most the sum of the areas of the
colored ovals. Therefore, it is bounded by |HB| times the maximum size of a colored
oval. Any sample S outside the colored ovals cannot cause the ERM rule to overﬁt.

.

Then, for any labeling function, f , and for any distribution, D, for which the
realizability assumption holds (that is, for some h ∈ H, L(D,f )(h) = 0), with
probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of an i.i.d. sample S of size m, we
have that for every ERM hypothesis, hS, it holds that

L(D,f )(hS) ≤ .

The preceeding corollary tells us that for a suﬃciently large m, the ERMH rule
over a ﬁnite hypothesis class will be probably (with conﬁdence 1−δ) approximately
(up to an error of ) correct. In the next chapter we formally deﬁne the model
of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning.

Exercises

1. Overﬁtting of polynomial matching: We have shown that the predictor
deﬁned in Equation (2.3) leads to overﬁtting. While this predictor seems to
be very unnatural, the goal of this exercise is to show that it can be described
as a thresholded polynomial. That is, show that given a training set S =
{(xi, f (xi))}m
i=1 ⊆ (Rd × {0, 1})m, there exists a polynomial pS such that
hS(x) = 1 if and only if pS(x) ≥ 0, where hS is as deﬁned in Equation (2.3).
It follows that learning the class of all thresholded polynomials using the ERM
rule may lead to overﬁtting.

2. Let H be a class of binary classiﬁers over a domain X . Let D be an unknown
distribution over X , and let f be the target hypothesis in H. Fix some h ∈ H.

classiﬁer h(a1,b1,a2,b2) by

A Formal Learning Model

In this chapter we deﬁne our main formal learning model – the PAC learning
model and its extensions. We will consider other notions of learnability in Chap-
ter 7.

3.1

PAC Learning

In the previous chapter we have shown that for a ﬁnite hypothesis class, if the
ERM rule with respect to that class is applied on a suﬃciently large training
sample (whose size is independent of the underlying distribution or labeling
function) then the output hypothesis will be probably approximately correct.
More generally, we now deﬁne Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning.
definition 3.1 (PAC Learnability) A hypothesis class H is PAC learnable
if there exist a function mH : (0, 1)2 → N and a learning algorithm with the
following property: For every , δ ∈ (0, 1), for every distribution D over X , and
for every labeling function f : X → {0, 1}, if the realizable assumption holds
with respect to H,D, f , then when running the learning algorithm on m ≥
mH(, δ) i.i.d. examples generated by D and labeled by f , the algorithm returns
a hypothesis h such that, with probability of at least 1 − δ (over the choice of
the examples), L(D,f )(h) ≤ .

The deﬁnition of Probably Approximately Correct learnability contains two
approximation parameters. The accuracy parameter  determines how far the
output classiﬁer can be from the optimal one (this corresponds to the “approx-
imately correct”), and a conﬁdence parameter δ indicating how likely the clas-
siﬁer is to meet that accuracy requirement (corresponds to the “probably” part
of “PAC”). Under the data access model that we are investigating, these ap-
proximations are inevitable. Since the training set is randomly generated, there
may always be a small chance that it will happen to be noninformative (for ex-
ample, there is always some chance that the training set will contain only one
domain point, sampled over and over again). Furthermore, even when we are
lucky enough to get a training sample that does faithfully represent D, because
it is just a ﬁnite sample, there may always be some ﬁne details of D that it fails

A Formal Learning Model

to reﬂect. Our accuracy parameter, , allows “forgiving” the learner’s classiﬁer
for making minor errors.

Sample Complexity
The function mH : (0, 1)2 → N determines the sample complexity of learning H:
that is, how many examples are required to guarantee a probably approximately
correct solution. The sample complexity is a function of the accuracy () and
conﬁdence (δ) parameters. It also depends on properties of the hypothesis class
H – for example, for a ﬁnite class we showed that the sample complexity depends
on log the size of H.
Note that if H is PAC learnable, there are many functions mH that satisfy the
requirements given in the deﬁnition of PAC learnability. Therefore, to be precise,
we will deﬁne the sample complexity of learning H to be the “minimal function,”
in the sense that for any , δ, mH(, δ) is the minimal integer that satisﬁes the
requirements of PAC learning with accuracy  and conﬁdence δ.

Let us now recall the conclusion of the analysis of ﬁnite hypothesis classes

from the previous chapter. It can be rephrased as stating:

corollary 3.2 Every ﬁnite hypothesis class is PAC learnable with sample
complexity

(cid:24) log(|H|/δ)

(cid:25)

mH(, δ) ≤

.



There are inﬁnite classes that are learnable as well (see, for example, Exer-
cise 3). Later on we will show that what determines the PAC learnability of
a class is not its ﬁniteness but rather a combinatorial measure called the VC
dimension.

3.2

A More General Learning Model

The model we have just described can be readily generalized, so that it can be
made relevant to a wider scope of learning tasks. We consider generalizations in
two aspects:

Removing the Realizability Assumption
We have required that the learning algorithm succeeds on a pair of data distri-
bution D and labeling function f provided that the realizability assumption is
met. For practical learning tasks, this assumption may be too strong (can we
really guarantee that there is a rectangle in the color-hardness space that fully
determines which papayas are tasty?). In the next subsection, we will describe
the agnostic PAC model in which this realizability assumption is waived.

3.2 A More General Learning Model

45

Learning Problems beyond Binary Classiﬁcation
The learning task that we have been discussing so far has to do with predicting a
binary label to a given example (like being tasty or not). However, many learning
tasks take a diﬀerent form. For example, one may wish to predict a real valued
number (say, the temperature at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow) or a label picked from
a ﬁnite set of labels (like the topic of the main story in tomorrow’s paper). It
turns out that our analysis of learning can be readily extended to such and many
other scenarios by allowing a variety of loss functions. We shall discuss that in
Section 3.2.2 later.

3.2.1

Releasing the Realizability Assumption – Agnostic PAC Learning

A More Realistic Model for the Data-Generating Distribution
Recall that the realizability assumption requires that there exists h(cid:63) ∈ H such
that Px∼D[h(cid:63)(x) = f (x)] = 1. In many practical problems this assumption does
not hold. Furthermore, it is maybe more realistic not to assume that the labels
are fully determined by the features we measure on input elements (in the case of
the papayas, it is plausible that two papayas of the same color and softness will
have diﬀerent taste). In the following, we relax the realizability assumption by
replacing the “target labeling function” with a more ﬂexible notion, a data-labels
generating distribution.

Formally, from now on, let D be a probability distribution over X ×Y, where,
as before, X is our domain set and Y is a set of labels (usually we will consider
Y = {0, 1}). That is, D is a joint distribution over domain points and labels. One
can view such a distribution as being composed of two parts: a distribution Dx
over unlabeled domain points (sometimes called the marginal distribution) and
a conditional probability over labels for each domain point, D((x, y)|x). In the
papaya example, Dx determines the probability of encountering a papaya whose
color and hardness fall in some color-hardness values domain, and the conditional
probability is the probability that a papaya with color and hardness represented
by x is tasty. Indeed, such modeling allows for two papayas that share the same
color and hardness to belong to diﬀerent taste categories.

The empirical and the True Error Revised
For a probability distribution, D, over X × Y, one can measure how likely h is
to make an error when labeled points are randomly drawn according to D. We
redeﬁne the true error (or risk) of a prediction rule h to be

LD(h) def=

P

(x,y)∼D[h(x) (cid:54)= y] def= D({(x, y) : h(x) (cid:54)= y}).

(3.1)

We would like to ﬁnd a predictor, h, for which that error will be minimized.
However, the learner does not know the data generating D. What the learner
does have access to is the training data, S. The deﬁnition of the empirical risk

46

A Formal Learning Model

remains the same as before, namely,

LS(h) def=

|{i ∈ [m] : h(xi) (cid:54)= yi}|

.

m

Given S, a learner can compute LS(h) for any function h : X → {0, 1}. Note
that LS(h) = LD(uniform over S)(h).

The Goal
We wish to ﬁnd some hypothesis, h : X → Y, that (probably approximately)
minimizes the true risk, LD(h).

The Bayes Optimal Predictor.
Given any probability distribution D over X × {0, 1}, the best label predicting
function from X to {0, 1} will be

(cid:40)

1

0

fD(x) =

if P[y = 1|x] ≥ 1/2
otherwise

It is easy to verify (see Exercise 7) that for every probability distribution D,
the Bayes optimal predictor fD is optimal, in the sense that no other classiﬁer,
g : X → {0, 1} has a lower error. That is, for every classiﬁer g, LD(fD) ≤ LD(g).
Unfortunately, since we do not know D, we cannot utilize this optimal predictor
fD. What the learner does have access to is the training sample. We can now
present the formal deﬁnition of agnostic PAC learnability, which is a natural
extension of the deﬁnition of PAC learnability to the more realistic, nonrealizable,
learning setup we have just discussed.

Clearly, we cannot hope that the learning algorithm will ﬁnd a hypothesis
whose error is smaller than the minimal possible error, that of the Bayes predic-
tor.

Furthermore, as we shall prove later, once we make no prior assumptions
about the data-generating distribution, no algorithm can be guaranteed to ﬁnd
a predictor that is as good as the Bayes optimal one. Instead, we require that
the learning algorithm will ﬁnd a predictor whose error is not much larger than
the best possible error of a predictor in some given benchmark hypothesis class.
Of course, the strength of such a requirement depends on the choice of that
hypothesis class.
definition 3.3 (Agnostic PAC Learnability) A hypothesis class H is agnostic
PAC learnable if there exist a function mH : (0, 1)2 → N and a learning algorithm
with the following property: For every , δ ∈ (0, 1) and for every distribution D
over X ×Y, when running the learning algorithm on m ≥ mH(, δ) i.i.d. examples
generated by D, the algorithm returns a hypothesis h such that, with probability
of at least 1 − δ (over the choice of the m training examples),

LD(h) ≤ min

h(cid:48)∈H LD(h(cid:48)) + .

3.2 A More General Learning Model

47

Clearly, if the realizability assumption holds, agnostic PAC learning provides
the same guarantee as PAC learning. In that sense, agnostic PAC learning gener-
alizes the deﬁnition of PAC learning. When the realizability assumption does not
hold, no learner can guarantee an arbitrarily small error. Nevertheless, under the
deﬁnition of agnostic PAC learning, a learner can still declare success if its error
is not much larger than the best error achievable by a predictor from the class H.
This is in contrast to PAC learning, in which the learner is required to achieve
a small error in absolute terms and not relative to the best error achievable by
the hypothesis class.

3.2.2

The Scope of Learning Problems Modeled

We next extend our model so that it can be applied to a wide variety of learning
tasks. Let us consider some examples of diﬀerent learning tasks.
• Multiclass Classiﬁcation Our classiﬁcation does not have to be binary.
Take, for example, the task of document classiﬁcation: We wish to design a
program that will be able to classify given documents according to topics
(e.g., news, sports, biology, medicine). A learning algorithm for such a task
will have access to examples of correctly classiﬁed documents and, on the
basis of these examples, should output a program that can take as input a
new document and output a topic classiﬁcation for that document. Here,
the domain set
is the set of all potential documents. Once again, we would
usually represent documents by a set of features that could include counts
of diﬀerent key words in the document, as well as other possibly relevant
features like the size of the document or its origin. The label set in this task
will be the set of possible document topics (so Y will be some large ﬁnite
set). Once we determine our domain and label sets, the other components
of our framework look exactly the same as in the papaya tasting example;
Our training sample will be a ﬁnite sequence of (feature vector, label) pairs,
the learner’s output will be a function from the domain set to the label set,
and, ﬁnally, for our measure of success, we can use the probability, over
(document, topic) pairs, of the event that our predictor suggests a wrong
label.

• Regression In this task, one wishes to ﬁnd some simple pattern in the data –
a functional relationship between the X and Y components of the data. For
example, one wishes to ﬁnd a linear function that best predicts a baby’s
birth weight on the basis of ultrasound measures of his head circumference,
abdominal circumference, and femur length. Here, our domain set X is some
subset of R3 (the three ultrasound measurements), and the set of “labels,”
Y, is the the set of real numbers (the weight in grams). In this context,
it is more adequate to call Y the target set. Our training data as well as
the learner’s output are as before (a ﬁnite sequence of (x, y) pairs, and
a function from X to Y respectively). However, our measure of success is

48

A Formal Learning Model

diﬀerent. We may evaluate the quality of a hypothesis function, h : X → Y,
by the expected square diﬀerence between the true labels and their predicted
values, namely,

LD(h) def=

(x,y)∼D(h(x) − y)2.
E

(3.2)

To accommodate a wide range of learning tasks we generalize our formalism

of the measure of success as follows:

Generalized Loss Functions
Given any set H (that plays the role of our hypotheses, or models) and some
domain Z let (cid:96) be any function from H×Z to the set of nonnegative real numbers,
(cid:96) : H × Z → R+.

We call such functions loss functions.
Note that for prediction problems, we have that Z = X × Y. However, our
notion of the loss function is generalized beyond prediction tasks, and therefore
it allows Z to be any domain of examples (for instance, in unsupervised learning
tasks such as the one described in Chapter 22, Z is not a product of an instance
domain and a label domain).
We now deﬁne the risk function to be the expected loss of a classiﬁer, h ∈ H,

with respect to a probability distribution D over Z, namely,

LD(h) def= E

z∼D[(cid:96)(h, z)].

(3.3)

That is, we consider the expectation of the loss of h over objects z picked ran-
domly according to D. Similarly, we deﬁne the empirical risk to be the expected
loss over a given sample S = (z1, . . . , zm) ∈ Z m, namely,

LS(h) def=

1
m

(cid:96)(h, zi).

(3.4)

m(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:40)

The loss functions used in the preceding examples of classiﬁcation and regres-

sion tasks are as follows:
• 0–1 loss: Here, our random variable z ranges over the set of pairs X ×Y and

the loss function is

(cid:96)0−1(h, (x, y)) def=

0

1

if h(x) = y
if h(x) (cid:54)= y

This loss function is used in binary or multiclass classiﬁcation problems.
One should note that, for a random variable, α, taking the values {0, 1},
Eα∼D[α] = Pα∼D[α = 1]. Consequently, for this loss function, the deﬁni-
tions of LD(h) given in Equation (3.3) and Equation (3.1) coincide.
• Square Loss: Here, our random variable z ranges over the set of pairs X ×Y

and the loss function is

(cid:96)sq(h, (x, y)) def= (h(x) − y)2.

3.3 Summary

49

This loss function is used in regression problems.

We will later see more examples of useful instantiations of loss functions.

To summarize, we formally deﬁne agnostic PAC learnability for general loss

functions.

definition 3.4 (Agnostic PAC Learnability for General Loss Functions) A
hypothesis class H is agnostic PAC learnable with respect to a set Z and a
loss function (cid:96) : H × Z → R+, if there exist a function mH : (0, 1)2 → N
and a learning algorithm with the following property: For every , δ ∈ (0, 1)
and for every distribution D over Z, when running the learning algorithm on
m ≥ mH(, δ) i.i.d. examples generated by D, the algorithm returns h ∈ H
such that, with probability of at least 1 − δ (over the choice of the m training
examples),

LD(h) ≤ min

h(cid:48)∈H LD(h(cid:48)) + ,

where LD(h) = Ez∼D[(cid:96)(h, z)].

Remark 3.1 (A Note About Measurability*)
In the aforementioned deﬁnition,
for every h ∈ H, we view the function (cid:96)(h,·) : Z → R+ as a random variable and
deﬁne LD(h) to be the expected value of this random variable. For that, we need
to require that the function (cid:96)(h,·) is measurable. Formally, we assume that there
is a σ-algebra of subsets of Z, over which the probability D is deﬁned, and that
the preimage of every initial segment in R+ is in this σ-algebra. In the speciﬁc
case of binary classiﬁcation with the 0−1 loss, the σ-algebra is over X × {0, 1}
and our assumption on (cid:96) is equivalent to the assumption that for every h, the
set {(x, h(x)) : x ∈ X} is in the σ-algebra.
Remark 3.2 (Proper versus Representation-Independent Learning*)
In the pre-
ceding deﬁnition, we required that the algorithm will return a hypothesis from
H. In some situations, H is a subset of a set H(cid:48), and the loss function can be
naturally extended to be a function from H(cid:48) × Z to the reals. In this case, we
may allow the algorithm to return a hypothesis h(cid:48) ∈ H(cid:48), as long as it satisﬁes
the requirement LD(h(cid:48)) ≤ minh∈H LD(h) + . Allowing the algorithm to output
a hypothesis from H(cid:48) is called representation independent learning, while proper
learning occurs when the algorithm must output a hypothesis from H. Represen-
tation independent learning is sometimes called “improper learning,” although
there is nothing improper in representation independent learning.

3.3

Summary

In this chapter we deﬁned our main formal learning model – PAC learning. The
basic model relies on the realizability assumption, while the agnostic variant does

50

A Formal Learning Model

not impose any restrictions on the underlying distribution over the examples. We
also generalized the PAC model to arbitrary loss functions. We will sometimes
refer to the most general model simply as PAC learning, omitting the “agnostic”
preﬁx and letting the reader infer what the underlying loss function is from the
context. When we would like to emphasize that we are dealing with the original
PAC setting we mention that the realizability assumption holds. In Chapter 7
we will discuss other notions of learnability.

3.4

Bibliographic Remarks

Our most general deﬁnition of agnostic PAC learning with general loss func-
tions follows the works of Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis (Vapnik &
Chervonenkis 1971). In particular, we follow Vapnik’s general setting of learning
(Vapnik 1982, Vapnik 1992, Vapnik 1995, Vapnik 1998).

PAC learning was introduced by Valiant (1984). Valiant was named the winner
of the 2010 Turing Award for the introduction of the PAC model. Valiant’s
deﬁnition requires that the sample complexity will be polynomial in 1/ and
in 1/δ, as well as in the representation size of hypotheses in the class (see also
Kearns & Vazirani (1994)). As we will see in Chapter 6, if a problem is at all PAC
learnable then the sample complexity depends polynomially on 1/ and log(1/δ).
Valiant’s deﬁnition also requires that the runtime of the learning algorithm will
be polynomial in these quantities. In contrast, we chose to distinguish between
the statistical aspect of learning and the computational aspect of learning. We
will elaborate on the computational aspect later on in Chapter 8, where we
introduce the full PAC learning model of Valiant. For expository reasons, we
use the term PAC learning even when we ignore the runtime aspect of learning.
Finally, the formalization of agnostic PAC learning is due to Haussler (1992).

1. Monotonicity of Sample Complexity: Let H be a hypothesis class for a
binary classiﬁcation task. Suppose that H is PAC learnable and its sample
complexity is given by mH(·,·). Show that mH is monotonically nonincreasing
in each of its parameters. That is, show that given δ ∈ (0, 1), and given 0 <
1 ≤ 2 < 1, we have that mH(1, δ) ≥ mH(2, δ). Similarly, show that given
 ∈ (0, 1), and given 0 < δ1 ≤ δ2 < 1, we have that mH(, δ1) ≥ mH(, δ2).

2. Let X be a discrete domain, and let HSingleton = {hz : z ∈ X} ∪ {h−}, where
for each z ∈ X , hz is the function deﬁned by hz(x) = 1 if x = z and hz(x) = 0

The realizability assumption here implies that the true hypothesis f labels
negatively all examples in the domain, perhaps except one.

4. In this question, we study the hypothesis class of Boolean conjunctions deﬁned
as follows. The instance space is X = {0, 1}d and the label set is Y = {0, 1}. A
literal over the variables x1, . . . , xd is a simple Boolean function that takes the
form f (x) = xi, for some i ∈ [d], or f (x) = 1− xi for some i ∈ [d]. We use the
notation ¯xi as a shorthand for 1− xi. A conjunction is any product of literals.
In Boolean logic, the product is denoted using the ∧ sign. For example, the
function h(x) = x1 · (1 − x2) is written as x1 ∧ ¯x2.

We consider the hypothesis class of all conjunctions of literals over the d
variables. The empty conjunction is interpreted as the all-positive hypothesis
(namely, the function that returns h(x) = 1 for all x). The conjunction x1∧ ¯x1
(and similarly any conjunction involving a literal and its negation) is allowed
and interpreted as the all-negative hypothesis (namely, the conjunction that
returns h(x) = 0 for all x). We assume realizability: Namely, we assume
that there exists a Boolean conjunction that generates the labels. Thus, each
example (x, y) ∈ X × Y consists of an assignment to the d Boolean variables
x1, . . . , xd, and its truth value (0 for false and 1 for true).
For instance, let d = 3 and suppose that the true conjunction is x1 ∧ ¯x2.

Then, the training set S might contain the following instances:

((1, 1, 1), 0), ((1, 0, 1), 1), ((0, 1, 0), 0)((1, 0, 0), 1).

Prove that the hypothesis class of all conjunctions over d variables is
PAC learnable and bound its sample complexity. Propose an algorithm that
implements the ERM rule, whose runtime is polynomial in d · m.
5. Let X be a domain and let D1,D2, . . . ,Dm be a sequence of distributions

Suppose we are getting a sample S of m examples, such that the instances are
independent but are not identically distributed; the ith instance is sampled
from Di and then yi is set to be f (xi). Let ¯Dm denote the average, that is,
¯Dm = (D1 + ··· + Dm)/m.

Fix an accuracy parameter  ∈ (0, 1). Show that

P(cid:2)∃h ∈ H s.t. L( ¯Dm,f )(h) >  and L(S,f )(h) = 0(cid:3) ≤ |H|e−m.

over X × {0, 1}.
1. A probabilistic label predictor is a function that assigns to every domain
point x a probability value, h(x) ∈ [0, 1], that determines the probability of
predicting the label 1. That is, given such an h and an input, x, the label for
x is predicted by tossing a coin with bias h(x) toward Heads and predicting
1 iﬀ the coin comes up Heads. Formally, we deﬁne a probabilistic label
predictor as a function, h : X → [0, 1]. The loss of such h on an example
(x, y) is deﬁned to be |h(x) − y|, which is exactly the probability that the
prediction of h will not be equal to y. Note that if h is deterministic, that
is, returns values in {0, 1}, then |h(x) − y| = 1[h(x)(cid:54)=y].
Prove that for every data-generating distribution D over X × {0, 1}, the
Bayes optimal predictor has the smallest risk (w.r.t. the loss function
(cid:96)(h, (x, y)) = |h(x)−y|, among all possible label predictors, including prob-

9. Consider a variant of the PAC model in which there are two example ora-
cles: one that generates positive examples and one that generates negative

X + = {x ∈ X : f (x) = 1} deﬁned by D+(A) = D(A)/D(X +), for every
A ⊂ X +. Similarly, D− is the distribution over X − induced by D.

The deﬁnition of PAC learnability in the two-oracle model is the same as the
standard deﬁnition of PAC learnability except that here the learner has access
to m+H(, δ) i.i.d. examples from D+ and m−(, δ) i.i.d. examples from D−. The
learner’s goal is to output h s.t. with probability at least 1− δ (over the choice

of the two training sets, and possibly over the nondeterministic decisions made
by the learning algorithm), both L(D+,f )(h) ≤  and L(D−,f )(h) ≤ .

Learning via Uniform Convergence

The ﬁrst formal learning model that we have discussed was the PAC model.
In Chapter 2 we have shown that under the realizability assumption, any ﬁnite
hypothesis class is PAC learnable. In this chapter we will develop a general tool,
uniform convergence, and apply it to show that any ﬁnite class is learnable in
the agnostic PAC model with general loss functions, as long as the range loss
function is bounded.

4.1

Uniform Convergence Is Suﬃcient for Learnability

The idea behind the learning condition discussed in this chapter is very simple.
Recall that, given a hypothesis class, H, the ERM learning paradigm works
as follows: Upon receiving a training sample, S, the learner evaluates the risk
(or error) of each h in H on the given sample and outputs a member of H that
minimizes this empirical risk. The hope is that an h that minimizes the empirical
risk with respect to S is a risk minimizer (or has risk close to the minimum) with
respect to the true data probability distribution as well. For that, it suﬃces to
ensure that the empirical risks of all members of H are good approximations of
their true risk. Put another way, we need that uniformly over all hypotheses in
the hypothesis class, the empirical risk will be close to the true risk, as formalized
in the following.

definition 4.1 (-representative sample) A training set S is called -representative
(w.r.t. domain Z, hypothesis class H, loss function (cid:96), and distribution D) if

∀h ∈ H,

|LS(h) − LD(h)| ≤ .

The next simple lemma states that whenever the sample is (/2)-representative,

the ERM learning rule is guaranteed to return a good hypothesis.

lemma 4.2 Assume that a training set S is 
2 -representative (w.r.t. domain
Z, hypothesis class H, loss function (cid:96), and distribution D). Then, any output of
ERMH(S), namely, any hS ∈ argminh∈H LS(h), satisﬁes

LD(hS) ≤ min

h∈H LD(h) + .

4.2 Finite Classes Are Agnostic PAC Learnable

55

Proof For every h ∈ H,

LD(hS) ≤ LS(hS) + 

2 ≤ LS(h) + 

2 ≤ LD(h) + 

2 + 

2 = LD(h) + ,

where the ﬁrst and third inequalities are due to the assumption that S is 
2 -
representative (Deﬁnition 4.1) and the second inequality holds since hS is an
ERM predictor.

The preceding lemma implies that to ensure that the ERM rule is an agnostic
PAC learner, it suﬃces to show that with probability of at least 1 − δ over the
random choice of a training set, it will be an -representative training set. The
uniform convergence condition formalizes this requirement.
definition 4.3 (Uniform Convergence) We say that a hypothesis class H has
the uniform convergence property (w.r.t. a domain Z and a loss function (cid:96)) if
there exists a function mUCH : (0, 1)2 → N such that for every , δ ∈ (0, 1) and
for every probability distribution D over Z, if S is a sample of m ≥ mUCH (, δ)
examples drawn i.i.d. according to D, then, with probability of at least 1 − δ, S
is -representative.

Similar to the deﬁnition of sample complexity for PAC learning, the function
mUCH measures the (minimal) sample complexity of obtaining the uniform con-
vergence property, namely, how many examples we need to ensure that with
probability of at least 1 − δ the sample would be -representative.
The term uniform here refers to having a ﬁxed sample size that works for all
members of H and over all possible probability distributions over the domain.
The following corollary follows directly from Lemma 4.2 and the deﬁnition of

uniform convergence.

If a class H has the uniform convergence property with a
corollary 4.4
function mUCH then the class is agnostically PAC learnable with the sample com-
plexity mH(, δ) ≤ mUCH (/2, δ). Furthermore, in that case, the ERMH paradigm
is a successful agnostic PAC learner for H.

4.2

Finite Classes Are Agnostic PAC Learnable

In view of Corollary 4.4, the claim that every ﬁnite hypothesis class is agnostic
PAC learnable will follow once we establish that uniform convergence holds for
a ﬁnite hypothesis class.

To show that uniform convergence holds we follow a two step argument, similar
to the derivation in Chapter 2. The ﬁrst step applies the union bound while the
second step employs a measure concentration inequality. We now explain these
two steps in detail.
Fix some , δ. We need to ﬁnd a sample size m that guarantees that for any
D, with probability of at least 1 − δ of the choice of S = (z1, . . . , zm) sampled

56

Learning via Uniform Convergence

i.i.d. from D we have that for all h ∈ H, |LS(h) − LD(h)| ≤ . That is,

Dm({S : ∀h ∈ H,|LS(h) − LD(h)| ≤ }) ≥ 1 − δ.

Equivalently, we need to show that

Dm({S : ∃h ∈ H,|LS(h) − LD(h)| > }) < δ.

Writing

{S : ∃h ∈ H,|LS(h) − LD(h)| > } = ∪h∈H{S : |LS(h) − LD(h)| > },

and applying the union bound (Lemma 2.2) we obtain

Dm({S : ∃h ∈ H,|LS(h) − LD(h)| > }) ≤ (cid:88)

Dm({S : |LS(h) − LD(h)| > }).

h∈H

(4.1)
Our second step will be to argue that each summand of the right-hand side
of this inequality is small enough (for a suﬃciently large m). That is, we will
show that for any ﬁxed hypothesis, h, (which is chosen in advance prior to the
sampling of the training set), the gap between the true and empirical risks,
|LS(h) − LD(h)|, is likely to be small.
i=1 (cid:96)(h, zi). Since
each zi is sampled i.i.d. from D, the expected value of the random variable
(cid:96)(h, zi) is LD(h). By the linearity of expectation, it follows that LD(h) is also
the expected value of LS(h). Hence, the quantity |LD(h)−LS(h)| is the deviation
of the random variable LS(h) from its expectation. We therefore need to show
that the measure of LS(h) is concentrated around its expected value.

Recall that LD(h) = Ez∼D[(cid:96)(h, z)] and that LS(h) = 1

(cid:80)m

m

A basic statistical fact, the law of large numbers, states that when m goes to
inﬁnity, empirical averages converge to their true expectation. This is true for
LS(h), since it is the empirical average of m i.i.d random variables. However, since
the law of large numbers is only an asymptotic result, it provides no information
about the gap between the empirically estimated error and its true value for any
given, ﬁnite, sample size.

Instead, we will use a measure concentration inequality due to Hoeﬀding, which

quantiﬁes the gap between empirical averages and their expected value.

lemma 4.5 (Hoeﬀding’s Inequality) Let θ1, . . . , θm be a sequence of i.i.d. ran-
dom variables and assume that for all i, E[θi] = µ and P[a ≤ θi ≤ b] = 1. Then,

further assume that the range of (cid:96) is [0, 1] and therefore θi ∈ [0, 1]. We therefore

Remark 4.1 (The “Discretization Trick”) While the preceding corollary only
applies to ﬁnite hypothesis classes, there is a simple trick that allows us to get
a very good estimate of the practical sample complexity of inﬁnite hypothesis
classes. Consider a hypothesis class that is parameterized by d parameters. For
example, let X = R, Y = {±1}, and the hypothesis class, H, be all functions
of the form hθ(x) = sign(x − θ). That is, each hypothesis is parameterized by
one parameter, θ ∈ R, and the hypothesis outputs 1 for all instances larger than
θ and outputs −1 for instances smaller than θ. This is a hypothesis class of an
inﬁnite size. However, if we are going to learn this hypothesis class in practice,
using a computer, we will probably maintain real numbers using ﬂoating point
representation, say, of 64 bits. It follows that in practice, our hypothesis class
is parameterized by the set of scalars that can be represented using a 64 bits
ﬂoating point number. There are at most 264 such numbers; hence the actual
size of our hypothesis class is at most 264. More generally, if our hypothesis class
is parameterized by d numbers, in practice we learn a hypothesis class of size at
most 264d. Applying Corollary 4.6 we obtain that the sample complexity of such

58

Learning via Uniform Convergence

2

classes is bounded by 128d+2 log(2/δ)
. This upper bound on the sample complex-
ity has the deﬁciency of being dependent on the speciﬁc representation of real
numbers used by our machine. In Chapter 6 we will introduce a rigorous way
to analyze the sample complexity of inﬁnite size hypothesis classes. Neverthe-
less, the discretization trick can be used to get a rough estimate of the sample
complexity in many practical situations.

4.3

Summary
If the uniform convergence property holds for a hypothesis class H then in most
cases the empirical risks of hypotheses in H will faithfully represent their true
risks. Uniform convergence suﬃces for agnostic PAC learnability using the ERM
rule. We have shown that ﬁnite hypothesis classes enjoy the uniform convergence
property and are hence agnostic PAC learnable.

4.4

Bibliographic Remarks

Classes of functions for which the uniform convergence property holds are also
called Glivenko-Cantelli classes, named after Valery Ivanovich Glivenko and
Francesco Paolo Cantelli, who proved the ﬁrst uniform convergence result in
the 1930s. See (Dudley, Gine & Zinn 1991). The relation between uniform con-
vergence and learnability was thoroughly studied by Vapnik – see (Vapnik 1992,
Vapnik 1995, Vapnik 1998). In fact, as we will see later in Chapter 6, the funda-
mental theorem of learning theory states that in binary classiﬁcation problems,
uniform convergence is not only a suﬃcient condition for learnability but is also
a necessary condition. This is not the case for more general learning problems
(see (Shalev-Shwartz, Shamir, Srebro & Sridharan 2010)).

The Bias-Complexity Tradeoﬀ

In Chapter 2 we saw that unless one is careful, the training data can mislead the
learner, and result in overﬁtting. To overcome this problem, we restricted the
search space to some hypothesis class H. Such a hypothesis class can be viewed
as reﬂecting some prior knowledge that the learner has about the task – a belief
that one of the members of the class H is a low-error model for the task. For
example, in our papayas taste problem, on the basis of our previous experience
with other fruits, we may assume that some rectangle in the color-hardness plane
predicts (at least approximately) the papaya’s tastiness.

Is such prior knowledge really necessary for the success of learning? Maybe
there exists some kind of universal learner, that is, a learner who has no prior
knowledge about a certain task and is ready to be challenged by any task? Let
us elaborate on this point. A speciﬁc learning task is deﬁned by an unknown
distribution D over X × Y, where the goal of the learner is to ﬁnd a predictor
h : X → Y, whose risk, LD(h), is small enough. The question is therefore whether
there exist a learning algorithm A and a training set size m, such that for every
distribution D, if A receives m i.i.d. examples from D, there is a high chance it
outputs a predictor h that has a low risk.

The ﬁrst part of this chapter addresses this question formally. The No-Free-
Lunch theorem states that no such universal learner exists. To be more precise,
the theorem states that for binary classiﬁcation prediction tasks, for every learner
there exists a distribution on which it fails. We say that the learner fails if, upon
receiving i.i.d. examples from that distribution, its output hypothesis is likely
to have a large risk, say, ≥ 0.3, whereas for the same distribution, there exists
another learner that will output a hypothesis with a small risk. In other words,
the theorem states that no learner can succeed on all learnable tasks – every
learner has tasks on which it fails while other learners succeed.

Therefore, when approaching a particular learning problem, deﬁned by some
distribution D, we should have some prior knowledge on D. One type of such prior
knowledge is that D comes from some speciﬁc parametric family of distributions.
We will study learning under such assumptions later on in Chapter 24. Another
type of prior knowledge on D, which we assumed when deﬁning the PAC learning
model, is that there exists h in some predeﬁned hypothesis class H, such that
LD(h) = 0. A softer type of prior knowledge on D is assuming that minh∈H LD(h)
is small. In a sense, this weaker assumption on D is a prerequisite for using the

agnostic PAC model, in which we require that the risk of the output hypothesis
will not be much larger than minh∈H LD(h).

In the second part of this chapter we study the beneﬁts and pitfalls of using
a hypothesis class as a means of formalizing prior knowledge. We decompose
the error of an ERM algorithm over a class H into two components. The ﬁrst
component reﬂects the quality of our prior knowledge, measured by the minimal
risk of a hypothesis in our hypothesis class, minh∈H LD(h). This component is
also called the approximation error, or the bias of the algorithm toward choosing
a hypothesis from H. The second component is the error due to overﬁtting,
which depends on the size or the complexity of the class H and is called the
estimation error. These two terms imply a tradeoﬀ between choosing a more
complex H (which can decrease the bias but increases the risk of overﬁtting)
or a less complex H (which might increase the bias but decreases the potential
overﬁtting).

5.1

The No-Free-Lunch Theorem

In this part we prove that there is no universal learner. We do this by showing
that no learner can succeed on all learning tasks, as formalized in the following
theorem:

theorem 5.1 (No-Free-Lunch) Let A be any learning algorithm for the task
of binary classiﬁcation with respect to the 0 − 1 loss over a domain X . Let m
be any number smaller than |X|/2, representing a training set size. Then, there
exists a distribution D over X × {0, 1} such that:
1. There exists a function f : X → {0, 1} with LD(f ) = 0.
2. With probability of at least 1/7 over the choice of S ∼ Dm we have that

LD(A(S)) ≥ 1/8.

This theorem states that for every learner, there exists a task on which it fails,
even though that task can be successfully learned by another learner. Indeed, a
trivial successful learner in this case would be an ERM learner with the hypoth-
esis class H = {f}, or more generally, ERM with respect to any ﬁnite hypothesis
class that contains f and whose size satisﬁes the equation m ≥ 8 log(7|H|/6) (see
Corollary 2.3).
Proof Let C be a subset of X of size 2m. The intuition of the proof is that
any learning algorithm that observes only half of the instances in C has no
information on what should be the labels of the rest of the instances in C.
Therefore, there exists a “reality,” that is, some target function f , that would
contradict the labels that A(S) predicts on the unobserved instances in C.
Note that there are T = 22m possible functions from C to {0, 1}. Denote these
functions by f1, . . . , fT . For each such function, let Di be a distribution over

62

The Bias-Complexity Tradeoﬀ

C × {0, 1} deﬁned by

(cid:40)

Di({(x, y)}) =

1/|C|
0

if y = fi(x)
otherwise.

That is, the probability to choose a pair (x, y) is 1/|C| if the label y is indeed
the true label according to fi, and the probability is 0 if y (cid:54)= fi(x). Clearly,
LDi(fi) = 0.
We will show that for every algorithm, A, that receives a training set of m
examples from C ×{0, 1} and returns a function A(S) : C → {0, 1}, it holds that

max
i∈[T ]

[LDi (A(S))] ≥ 1/4.

(5.1)

Clearly, this means that for every algorithm, A(cid:48), that receives a training set of m
examples from X ×{0, 1} there exist a function f : X → {0, 1} and a distribution
D over X × {0, 1}, such that LD(f ) = 0 and

E

[LD(A(cid:48)(S))] ≥ 1/4.

(5.2)
It is easy to verify that the preceding suﬃces for showing that P[LD(A(cid:48)(S)) ≥
1/8] ≥ 1/7, which is what we need to prove (see Exercise 1).

S∼Dm

We now turn to proving that Equation (5.1) holds. There are k = (2m)m
possible sequences of m examples from C. Denote these sequences by S1, . . . , Sk.
Also, if Sj = (x1, . . . , xm) we denote by Si
j the sequence containing the instances
in Sj labeled by the function fi, namely, Si
j = ((x1, fi(x1)), . . . , (xm, fi(xm))). If
the distribution is Di then the possible training sets A can receive are Si
1, . . . , Si
k,
and all these training sets have the same probability of being sampled. Therefore,

Next, ﬁx some j ∈ [k]. Denote Sj = (x1, . . . , xm) and let v1, . . . , vp be the
examples in C that do not appear in Sj. Clearly, p ≥ m. Therefore, for every

Next, ﬁx some r ∈ [p]. We can partition all the functions in f1, . . . , fT into T /2
disjoint pairs, where for a pair (fi, fi(cid:48)) we have that for every c ∈ C, fi(c) (cid:54)= fi(cid:48)(c)
if and only if c = vr. Since for such a pair we must have Si
j , it follows that

j = Si(cid:48)

[A(Si

[A(Si(cid:48)

which yields

Combining this with Equation (5.6), Equation (5.4), and Equation (5.3), we
obtain that Equation (5.1) holds, which concludes our proof.

5.1.1

No-Free-Lunch and Prior Knowledge

How does the No-Free-Lunch result relate to the need for prior knowledge? Let us
consider an ERM predictor over the hypothesis class H of all the functions f from
X to {0, 1}. This class represents lack of prior knowledge: Every possible function
from the domain to the label set is considered a good candidate. According to the
No-Free-Lunch theorem, any algorithm that chooses its output from hypotheses
in H, and in particular the ERM predictor, will fail on some learning task.
Therefore, this class is not PAC learnable, as formalized in the following corollary:
corollary 5.2 Let X be an inﬁnite domain set and let H be the set of all
functions from X to {0, 1}. Then, H is not PAC learnable.

64

The Bias-Complexity Tradeoﬀ

Proof Assume, by way of contradiction, that the class is learnable. Choose
some  < 1/8 and δ < 1/7. By the deﬁnition of PAC learnability, there must
be some learning algorithm A and an integer m = m(, δ), such that for any
data-generating distribution over X ×{0, 1}, if for some function f : X → {0, 1},
LD(f ) = 0, then with probability greater than 1 − δ when A is applied to
samples S of size m, generated i.i.d. by D, LD(A(S)) ≤ . However, applying
the No-Free-Lunch theorem, since |X| > 2m, for every learning algorithm (and
in particular for the algorithm A), there exists a distribution D such that with
probability greater than 1/7 > δ, LD(A(S)) > 1/8 > , which leads to the
desired contradiction.

How can we prevent such failures? We can escape the hazards foreseen by the
No-Free-Lunch theorem by using our prior knowledge about a speciﬁc learning
task, to avoid the distributions that will cause us to fail when learning that task.
Such prior knowledge can be expressed by restricting our hypothesis class.

But how should we choose a good hypothesis class? On the one hand, we want
to believe that this class includes the hypothesis that has no error at all (in the
PAC setting), or at least that the smallest error achievable by a hypothesis from
this class is indeed rather small (in the agnostic setting). On the other hand,
we have just seen that we cannot simply choose the richest class – the class of
all functions over the given domain. This tradeoﬀ is discussed in the following
section.

5.2

Error Decomposition

To answer this question we decompose the error of an ERMH predictor into two
components as follows. Let hS be an ERMH hypothesis. Then, we can write

LD(hS) = app + est where : app = min

h∈H LD(h),

est = LD(hS)− app. (5.7)

• The Approximation Error – the minimum risk achievable by a predictor
in the hypothesis class. This term measures how much risk we have because
we restrict ourselves to a speciﬁc class, namely, how much inductive bias we
have. The approximation error does not depend on the sample size and is
determined by the hypothesis class chosen. Enlarging the hypothesis class
can decrease the approximation error.

Under the realizability assumption, the approximation error is zero. In

the agnostic case, however, the approximation error can be large.1

1 In fact, it always includes the error of the Bayes optimal predictor (see Chapter 3), the

minimal yet inevitable error, because of the possible nondeterminism of the world in this
model. Sometimes in the literature the term approximation error refers not to
minh∈H LD(h), but rather to the excess error over that of the Bayes optimal predictor,
namely, minh∈H LD(h) − Bayes.

5.3 Summary

65

• The Estimation Error – the diﬀerence between the approximation error
and the error achieved by the ERM predictor. The estimation error results
because the empirical risk (i.e., training error) is only an estimate of the
true risk, and so the predictor minimizing the empirical risk is only an
estimate of the predictor minimizing the true risk.

The quality of this estimation depends on the training set size and
on the size, or complexity, of the hypothesis class. As we have shown, for
a ﬁnite hypothesis class, est increases (logarithmically) with |H| and de-
creases with m. We can think of the size of H as a measure of its complexity.
In future chapters we will deﬁne other complexity measures of hypothesis
classes.

Since our goal is to minimize the total risk, we face a tradeoﬀ, called the bias-
complexity tradeoﬀ. On one hand, choosing H to be a very rich class decreases the
approximation error but at the same time might increase the estimation error,
as a rich H might lead to overﬁtting. On the other hand, choosing H to be a
very small set reduces the estimation error but might increase the approximation
error or, in other words, might lead to underﬁtting. Of course, a great choice for
H is the class that contains only one classiﬁer – the Bayes optimal classiﬁer. But
the Bayes optimal classiﬁer depends on the underlying distribution D, which we
do not know (indeed, learning would have been unnecessary had we known D).
Learning theory studies how rich we can make H while still maintaining rea-
sonable estimation error. In many cases, empirical research focuses on designing
good hypothesis classes for a certain domain. Here, “good” means classes for
which the approximation error would not be excessively high. The idea is that
although we are not experts and do not know how to construct the optimal clas-
siﬁer, we still have some prior knowledge of the speciﬁc problem at hand, which
enables us to design hypothesis classes for which both the approximation error
and the estimation error are not too large. Getting back to our papayas example,
we do not know how exactly the color and hardness of a papaya predict its taste,
but we do know that papaya is a fruit and on the basis of previous experience
with other fruit we conjecture that a rectangle in the color-hardness space may
be a good predictor.

5.3

Summary

The No-Free-Lunch theorem states that there is no universal learner. Every
learner has to be speciﬁed to some task, and use some prior knowledge about
that task, in order to succeed. So far we have modeled our prior knowledge by
restricting our output hypothesis to be a member of a chosen hypothesis class.
When choosing this hypothesis class, we face a tradeoﬀ, between a larger, or
more complex, class that is more likely to have a small approximation error,
and a more restricted class that would guarantee that the estimation error will

be small. In the next chapter we will study in more detail the behavior of the
estimation error. In Chapter 7 we will discuss alternative ways to express prior
knowledge.

Bibliographic Remarks

(Wolpert & Macready 1997) proved several no-free-lunch theorems for optimiza-
tion, but these are rather diﬀerent from the theorem we prove here. The theorem
we prove here is closely related to lower bounds in VC theory, as we will study
in the next chapter.

The VC-Dimension

In the previous chapter, we decomposed the error of the ERMH rule into ap-
proximation error and estimation error. The approximation error depends on
the ﬁt of our prior knowledge (as reﬂected by the choice of the hypothesis class
H) to the underlying unknown distribution. In contrast, the deﬁnition of PAC
learnability requires that the estimation error would be bounded uniformly over
all distributions.

Our current goal is to ﬁgure out which classes H are PAC learnable, and to
characterize exactly the sample complexity of learning a given hypothesis class.
So far we have seen that ﬁnite classes are learnable, but that the class of all
functions (over an inﬁnite size domain) is not. What makes one class learnable
and the other unlearnable? Can inﬁnite-size classes be learnable, and, if so, what
determines their sample complexity?

We begin the chapter by showing that inﬁnite classes can indeed be learn-
able, and thus, ﬁniteness of the hypothesis class is not a necessary condition for
learnability. We then present a remarkably crisp characterization of the family
of learnable classes in the setup of binary valued classiﬁcation with the zero-one
loss. This characterization was ﬁrst discovered by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey
Chervonenkis in 1970 and relies on a combinatorial notion called the Vapnik-
Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dimension). We formally deﬁne the VC-dimension,
provide several examples, and then state the fundamental theorem of statistical
learning theory, which integrates the concepts of learnability, VC-dimension, the
ERM rule, and uniform convergence.

6.1

Inﬁnite-Size Classes Can Be Learnable

In Chapter 4 we saw that ﬁnite classes are learnable, and in fact the sample
complexity of a hypothesis class is upper bounded by the log of its size. To show
that the size of the hypothesis class is not the right characterization of its sample
complexity, we ﬁrst present a simple example of an inﬁnite-size hypothesis class
that is learnable.
Example 6.1 Let H be the set of threshold functions over the real line, namely,
H = {ha : a ∈ R}, where ha : R → {0, 1} is a function such that ha(x) = 1[x<a].
To remind the reader, 1[x<a] is 1 if x < a and 0 otherwise. Clearly, H is of inﬁnite

size. Nevertheless, the following lemma shows that H is learnable in the PAC
model using the ERM algorithm.
Lemma 6.1 Let H be the class of thresholds as deﬁned earlier. Then, H is

is positive we set b0 = −∞ and if no example in S is negative we set b1 = ∞).
Let bS be a threshold corresponding to an ERM hypothesis, hS, which implies
that bS ∈ (b0, b1). Therefore, a suﬃcient condition for LD(hS) ≤  is that both
b0 ≥ a0 and b1 ≤ a1. In other words,

P

S∼Dm

[LD(hS) > ] ≤ P
S∼Dm

[b0 < a0 ∨ b1 > a1],

and using the union bound we can bound the preceding by

P

S∼Dm

[LD(hS) > ] ≤ P
S∼Dm

[b0 < a0] + P

S∼Dm

[b1 > a1].

(6.1)

The event b0 < a0 happens if and only if all examples in S are not in the interval
(a0, a∗), whose probability mass is deﬁned to be , namely,

P

S∼Dm

[b0 < a0] = P

S∼Dm

[∀(x, y) ∈ S, x (cid:54)∈ (a0, a(cid:63))] = (1 − )m ≤ e− m.

Since we assume m > log(2/δ)/ it follows that the equation is at most δ/2.
In the same way it is easy to see that PS∼Dm [b1 > a1] ≤ δ/2. Combining with
Equation (6.1) we conclude our proof.

6.2

The VC-Dimension
We see, therefore, that while ﬁniteness of H is a suﬃcient condition for learn-
ability, it is not a necessary condition. As we will show, a property called the
VC-dimension of a hypothesis class gives the correct characterization of its learn-
ability. To motivate the deﬁnition of the VC-dimension, let us recall the No-Free-
Lunch theorem (Theorem 5.1) and its proof. There, we have shown that without

restricting the hypothesis class, for any learning algorithm, an adversary can
construct a distribution for which the learning algorithm will perform poorly,
while there is another learning algorithm that will succeed on the same distri-
bution. To do so, the adversary used a ﬁnite set C ⊂ X and considered a family
of distributions that are concentrated on elements of C. Each distribution was
derived from a “true” target function from C to {0, 1}. To make any algorithm
fail, the adversary used the power of choosing a target function from the set of
all possible functions from C to {0, 1}.

When considering PAC learnability of a hypothesis class H, the adversary
is restricted to constructing distributions for which some hypothesis h ∈ H
achieves a zero risk. Since we are considering distributions that are concentrated
on elements of C, we should study how H behaves on C, which leads to the
following deﬁnition.
definition 6.2 (Restriction of H to C) Let H be a class of functions from X
to {0, 1} and let C = {c1, . . . , cm} ⊂ X . The restriction of H to C is the set of
functions from C to {0, 1} that can be derived from H. That is,

HC = {(h(c1), . . . , h(cm)) : h ∈ H},

where we represent each function from C to {0, 1} as a vector in {0, 1}|C|.

If the restriction of H to C is the set of all functions from C to {0, 1}, then

we say that H shatters the set C. Formally:
definition 6.3 (Shattering) A hypothesis class H shatters a ﬁnite set C ⊂ X
if the restriction of H to C is the set of all functions from C to {0, 1}. That is,
|HC| = 2|C|.
Example 6.2 Let H be the class of threshold functions over R. Take a set
C = {c1}. Now, if we take a = c1 + 1, then we have ha(c1) = 1, and if we take
a = c1 − 1, then we have ha(c1) = 0. Therefore, HC is the set of all functions
from C to {0, 1}, and H shatters C. Now take a set C = {c1, c2}, where c1 ≤ c2.
No h ∈ H can account for the labeling (0, 1), because any threshold that assigns
the label 0 to c1 must assign the label 0 to c2 as well. Therefore not all functions
from C to {0, 1} are included in HC; hence C is not shattered by H.

Getting back to the construction of an adversarial distribution as in the proof
of the No-Free-Lunch theorem (Theorem 5.1), we see that whenever some set C
is shattered by H, the adversary is not restricted by H, as they can construct
a distribution over C based on any target function from C to {0, 1}, while still
maintaining the realizability assumption. This immediately yields:
corollary 6.4 Let H be a hypothesis class of functions from X to {0, 1}. Let
m be a training set size. Assume that there exists a set C ⊂ X of size 2m that is
shattered by H. Then, for any learning algorithm, A, there exist a distribution D
over X × {0, 1} and a predictor h ∈ H such that LD(h) = 0 but with probability
of at least 1/7 over the choice of S ∼ Dm we have that LD(A(S)) ≥ 1/8.

70

The VC-Dimension

Corollary 6.4 tells us that if H shatters some set C of size 2m then we cannot
learn H using m examples. Intuitively, if a set C is shattered by H, and we
receive a sample containing half the instances of C, the labels of these instances
give us no information about the labels of the rest of the instances in C – every
possible labeling of the rest of the instances can be explained by some hypothesis
in H. Philosophically,

If someone can explain every phenomenon, his explanations are worthless.

This leads us directly to the deﬁnition of the VC dimension.

definition 6.5 (VC-dimension) The VC-dimension of a hypothesis class H,
denoted VCdim(H), is the maximal size of a set C ⊂ X that can be shattered
by H. If H can shatter sets of arbitrarily large size we say that H has inﬁnite
VC-dimension.

A direct consequence of Corollary 6.4 is therefore:

theorem 6.6 Let H be a class of inﬁnite VC-dimension. Then, H is not PAC
learnable.
Proof Since H has an inﬁnite VC-dimension, for any training set size m, there
exists a shattered set of size 2m, and the claim follows by Corollary 6.4.

We shall see later in this chapter that the converse is also true: A ﬁnite VC-
dimension guarantees learnability. Hence, the VC-dimension characterizes PAC
learnability. But before delving into more theory, we ﬁrst show several examples.

6.3

Examples

In this section we calculate the VC-dimension of several hypothesis classes. To
show that VCdim(H) = d we need to show that

1. There exists a set C of size d that is shattered by H.
2. Every set C of size d + 1 is not shattered by H.

6.3.1

Threshold Functions
Let H be the class of threshold functions over R. Recall Example 6.2, where
we have shown that for an arbitrary set C = {c1}, H shatters C; therefore
VCdim(H) ≥ 1. We have also shown that for an arbitrary set C = {c1, c2} where
c1 ≤ c2, H does not shatter C. We therefore conclude that VCdim(H) = 1.

6.3 Examples

71

6.3.2

Intervals
Let H be the class of intervals over R, namely, H = {ha,b : a, b ∈ R, a < b},
where ha,b : R → {0, 1} is a function such that ha,b(x) = 1[x∈(a,b)]. Take the set
C = {1, 2}. Then, H shatters C (make sure you understand why) and therefore
VCdim(H) ≥ 2. Now take an arbitrary set C = {c1, c2, c3} and assume without
loss of generality that c1 ≤ c2 ≤ c3. Then, the labeling (1, 0, 1) cannot be obtained
by an interval and therefore H does not shatter C. We therefore conclude that
VCdim(H) = 2.

6.3.3

Axis Aligned Rectangles
Let H be the class of axis aligned rectangles, formally:

H = {h(a1,a2,b1,b2) : a1 ≤ a2 and b1 ≤ b2}

where

h(a1,a2,b1,b2)(x1, x2) =

(cid:40)

if a1 ≤ x1 ≤ a2 and b1 ≤ x2 ≤ b2
otherwise

0

(6.2)

We shall show in the following that VCdim(H) = 4. To prove this we need
to ﬁnd a set of 4 points that are shattered by H, and show that no set of 5
points can be shattered by H. Finding a set of 4 points that are shattered is
easy (see Figure 6.1). Now, consider any set C ⊂ R2 of 5 points. In C, take a
leftmost point (whose ﬁrst coordinate is the smallest in C), a rightmost point
(ﬁrst coordinate is the largest), a lowest point (second coordinate is the smallest),
and a highest point (second coordinate is the largest). Without loss of generality,
denote C = {c1, . . . , c5} and let c5 be the point that was not selected. Now,
deﬁne the labeling (1, 1, 1, 1, 0). It is impossible to obtain this labeling by an
axis aligned rectangle. Indeed, such a rectangle must contain c1, . . . , c4; but in
this case the rectangle contains c5 as well, because its coordinates are within
the intervals deﬁned by the selected points. So, C is not shattered by H, and
therefore VCdim(H) = 4.

6.3.4

Finite Classes
Let H be a ﬁnite class. Then, clearly, for any set C we have |HC| ≤ |H| and thus C
cannot be shattered if |H| < 2|C|. This implies that VCdim(H) ≤ log2(|H|). This
shows that the PAC learnability of ﬁnite classes follows from the more general
statement of PAC learnability of classes with ﬁnite VC-dimension, which we shall
see in the next section. Note, however, that the VC-dimension of a ﬁnite class
H can be signiﬁcantly smaller than log2(|H|). For example, let X = {1, . . . , k},
for some integer k, and consider the class of threshold functions (as deﬁned in
Example 6.2). Then, |H| = k but VCdim(H) = 1. Since k can be arbitrarily
large, the gap between log2(|H|) and VCdim(H) can be arbitrarily large.

6.3.5

VC-Dimension and the Number of Parameters

In the previous examples, the VC-dimension happened to equal the number of
parameters deﬁning the hypothesis class. While this is often the case, it is not
always true. Consider, for example, the domain X = R, and the hypothesis class
H = {hθ : θ ∈ R} where hθ : X → {0, 1} is deﬁned by hθ(x) = (cid:100)0.5 sin(θx)(cid:101). It
is possible to prove that VCdim(H) = ∞, namely, for every d, one can ﬁnd d
points that are shattered by H (see Exercise 8).

6.4

The Fundamental Theorem of PAC learning

We have already shown that a class of inﬁnite VC-dimension is not learnable. The
converse statement is also true, leading to the fundamental theorem of statistical
learning theory:
theorem 6.7 (The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning) Let H be a
hypothesis class of functions from a domain X to {0, 1} and let the loss function
be the 0 − 1 loss. Then, the following are equivalent:
1. H has the uniform convergence property.
2. Any ERM rule is a successful agnostic PAC learner for H.
3. H is agnostic PAC learnable.
4. H is PAC learnable.
5. Any ERM rule is a successful PAC learner for H.
6. H has a ﬁnite VC-dimension.

The proof of the theorem is given in the next section.
Not only does the VC-dimension characterize PAC learnability; it even deter-

mines the sample complexity.

theorem 6.8 (The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning – Quantita-
tive Version) Let H be a hypothesis class of functions from a domain X to {0, 1}
and let the loss function be the 0 − 1 loss. Assume that VCdim(H) = d < ∞.
Then, there are absolute constants C1, C2 such that:

The proof of this theorem is given in Chapter 28.

Remark 6.3 We stated the fundamental theorem for binary classiﬁcation tasks.
A similar result holds for some other learning problems such as regression with
the absolute loss or the squared loss. However, the theorem does not hold for
all learning tasks. In particular, learnability is sometimes possible even though
the uniform convergence property does not hold (we will see an example in
Chapter 13, Exercise 2). Furthermore, in some situations, the ERM rule fails
but learnability is possible with other learning rules.

Proof of Theorem 6.7
We have already seen that 1 → 2 in Chapter 4. The implications 2 → 3 and
3 → 4 are trivial and so is 2 → 5. The implications 4 → 6 and 5 → 6 follow from
the No-Free-Lunch theorem. The diﬃcult part is to show that 6 → 1. The proof
is based on two main claims:
• If VCdim(H) = d, then even though H might be inﬁnite, when restricting it
to a ﬁnite set C ⊂ X , its “eﬀective” size, |HC|, is only O(|C|d). That is,
the size of HC grows polynomially rather than exponentially with |C|. This
claim is often referred to as Sauer’s lemma, but it has also been stated and
proved independently by Shelah and by Perles. The formal statement is
given in Section 6.5.1 later.
• In Section 4 we have shown that ﬁnite hypothesis classes enjoy the uniform
convergence property. In Section 6.5.2 later we generalize this result and
show that uniform convergence holds whenever the hypothesis class has a
“small eﬀective size.” By “small eﬀective size” we mean classes for which
|HC| grows polynomially with |C|.

6.5.1

Sauer’s Lemma and the Growth Function
We deﬁned the notion of shattering, by considering the restriction of H to a ﬁnite
set of instances. The growth function measures the maximal “eﬀective” size of
H on a set of m examples. Formally:

74

The VC-Dimension

definition 6.9 (Growth Function) Let H be a hypothesis class. Then the
growth function of H, denoted τH : N → N, is deﬁned as

(cid:12)(cid:12)HC

(cid:12)(cid:12) .

τH(m) =

max

C⊂X :|C|=m

In words, τH (m) is the number of diﬀerent functions from a set C of size m to
{0, 1} that can be obtained by restricting H to C.

Obviously, if VCdim(H) = d then for any m ≤ d we have τH(m) = 2m. In
such cases, H induces all possible functions from C to {0, 1}. The following beau-
tiful lemma, proposed independently by Sauer, Shelah, and Perles, shows that
when m becomes larger than the VC-dimension, the growth function increases
polynomially rather than exponentially with m.
lemma 6.10 (Sauer-Shelah-Perles) Let H be a hypothesis class with VCdim(H) ≤
τH(m) ≤ (em/d)d.

d < ∞. Then, for all m, τH(m) ≤(cid:80)d

(cid:1). In particular, if m > d + 1 then

(cid:0)m

i=0

Proof of Sauer’s Lemma *
To prove the lemma it suﬃces to prove the following stronger claim: For any
C = {c1, . . . , cm} we have

∀H,

|HC| ≤ |{B ⊆ C : H shatters B}|.

(6.3)

The reason why Equation (6.3) is suﬃcient to prove the lemma is that if VCdim(H) ≤
d then no set whose size is larger than d is shattered by H and therefore

|{B ⊆ C : H shatters B}| ≤ d(cid:88)

(cid:18)m

(cid:19)

.

i

i=0

When m > d + 1 the right-hand side of the preceding is at most (em/d)d (see
Lemma A.5 in Appendix A).

We are left with proving Equation (6.3) and we do it using an inductive argu-
ment. For m = 1, no matter what H is, either both sides of Equation (6.3) equal
1 or both sides equal 2 (the empty set is always considered to be shattered by
H). Assume Equation (6.3) holds for sets of size k < m and let us prove it for
sets of size m. Fix H and C = {c1, . . . , cm}. Denote C(cid:48) = {c2, . . . , cm} and in
addition, deﬁne the following two sets:

Y0 = {(y2, . . . , ym) : (0, y2, . . . , ym) ∈ HC ∨ (1, y2, . . . , ym) ∈ HC},

and

Y1 = {(y2, . . . , ym) : (0, y2, . . . , ym) ∈ HC ∧ (1, y2, . . . , ym) ∈ HC}.

It is easy to verify that |HC| = |Y0| + |Y1|. Additionally, since Y0 = HC(cid:48), using
the induction assumption (applied on H and C(cid:48)) we have that
|Y0| = |HC(cid:48)| ≤ |{B ⊆ C(cid:48) : H shatters B}| = |{B ⊆ C : c1 (cid:54)∈ B ∧ H shatters B}|.

6.5 Proof of Theorem 6.7

75

Next, deﬁne H(cid:48) ⊆ H to be

H(cid:48) = {h ∈ H : ∃h(cid:48) ∈ H s.t. (1 − h(cid:48)(c1), h(cid:48)(c2), . . . , h(cid:48)(cm))

= (h(c1), h(c2), . . . , h(cm)},

namely, H(cid:48) contains pairs of hypotheses that agree on C(cid:48) and diﬀer on c1. Using
this deﬁnition, it is clear that if H(cid:48) shatters a set B ⊆ C(cid:48) then it also shatters
the set B ∪{c1} and vice versa. Combining this with the fact that Y1 = H(cid:48)
C(cid:48) and
using the inductive assumption (now applied on H(cid:48) and C(cid:48)) we obtain that
|Y1| = |H(cid:48)

C(cid:48)| ≤ |{B ⊆ C(cid:48) : H(cid:48) shatters B}| = |{B ⊆ C(cid:48) : H(cid:48) shatters B ∪ {c1}}|
= |{B ⊆ C : c1 ∈ B ∧ H(cid:48) shatters B}| ≤ |{B ⊆ C : c1 ∈ B ∧ H shatters B}|.

Overall, we have shown that
|HC| = |Y0| + |Y1|

≤ |{B ⊆ C : c1 (cid:54)∈ B ∧ H shatters B}| + |{B ⊆ C : c1 ∈ B ∧ H shatters B}|
= |{B ⊆ C : H shatters B}|,

which concludes our proof.

6.5.2

Uniform Convergence for Classes of Small Eﬀective Size
In this section we prove that if H has small eﬀective size then it enjoys the
uniform convergence property. Formally,
theorem 6.11 Let H be a class and let τH be its growth function. Then, for
every D and every δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of
S ∼ Dm we have

|LD(h) − LS(h)| ≤ 4 +(cid:112)log(τH(2m))

The expectation on the right-hand side is over a choice of two i.i.d. samples
S = z1, . . . , zm and S(cid:48) = z(cid:48)
m. Since all of these 2m vectors are chosen
i.i.d., nothing will change if we replace the name of the random vector zi with the
i)− (cid:96)(h, zi))
name of the random vector z(cid:48)
i) − (cid:96)(h, zi)). It follows that for
in Equation (6.5) we will have the term −((cid:96)(h, z(cid:48)
every σ ∈ {±1}m we have that Equation (6.5) equals

The VC-Dimension

6.6

Summary

The fundamental theorem of learning theory characterizes PAC learnability of
classes of binary classiﬁers using VC-dimension. The VC-dimension of a class
is a combinatorial property that denotes the maximal sample size that can be
shattered by the class. The fundamental theorem states that a class is PAC learn-
able if and only if its VC-dimension is ﬁnite and speciﬁes the sample complexity
required for PAC learning. The theorem also shows that if a problem is at all
learnable, then uniform convergence holds and therefore the problem is learnable
using the ERM rule.

6.7

Bibliographic remarks

The deﬁnition of VC-dimension and its relation to learnability and to uniform
convergence is due to the seminal work of Vapnik & Chervonenkis (1971). The
relation to the deﬁnition of PAC learnability is due to Blumer, Ehrenfeucht,
Haussler & Warmuth (1989).

Several generalizations of the VC-dimension have been proposed. For exam-
ple, the fat-shattering dimension characterizes learnability of some regression
problems (Kearns, Schapire & Sellie 1994, Alon, Ben-David, Cesa-Bianchi &
Haussler 1997, Bartlett, Long & Williamson 1994, Anthony & Bartlet 1999), and
the Natarajan dimension characterizes learnability of some multiclass learning
problems (Natarajan 1989). However, in general, there is no equivalence between
learnability and uniform convergence. See (Shalev-Shwartz, Shamir, Srebro &
Sridharan 2010, Daniely, Sabato, Ben-David & Shalev-Shwartz 2011).

Sauer’s lemma has been proved by Sauer in response to a problem of Erdos
(Sauer 1972). Shelah (with Perles) proved it as a useful lemma for Shelah’s theory
of stable models (Shelah 1972). Gil Kalai tells1 us that at some later time, Benjy
Weiss asked Perles about such a result in the context of ergodic theory, and
Perles, who forgot that he had proved it once, proved it again. Vapnik and
Chervonenkis proved the lemma in the context of statistical learning theory.

7. We have shown that for a ﬁnite hypothesis class H, VCdim(H) ≤ (cid:98)log(|H|)(cid:99).
However, this is just an upper bound. The VC-dimension of a class can be
much lower than that:
1. Find an example of a class H of functions over the real interval X = [0, 1]

2. Give an example of a ﬁnite hypothesis class H over the domain X = [0, 1],

8. (*) It is often the case that the VC-dimension of a hypothesis class equals (or
can be bounded above by) the number of parameters one needs to set in order
to deﬁne each hypothesis in the class. For instance, if H is the class of axis
aligned rectangles in Rd, then VCdim(H) = 2d, which is equal to the number
of parameters used to deﬁne a rectangle in Rd. Here is an example that shows
that this is not always the case. We will see that a hypothesis class might
be very complex and even not learnable, although it has a small number of
parameters.

Consider the domain X = R, and the hypothesis class

12. Dudley classes: In this question we discuss an algebraic framework for
deﬁning concept classes over Rn and show a connection between the VC
dimension of such classes and their algebraic properties. Given a function
f : Rn → R we deﬁne the corresponding function, POS (f )(x) = 1[f (x)>0]. For
a class F of real valued functions we deﬁne a corresponding class of functions
POS (F) = {POS (f ) : f ∈ F}. We say that a family, F, of real valued func-
tions is linearly closed if for all f, g ∈ F and r ∈ R, (f + rg) ∈ F (where
addition and scalar multiplication of functions are deﬁned point wise, namely,
for all x ∈ Rn, (f + rg)(x) = f (x) + rg(x)). Note that if a family of functions
is linearly closed then we can view it as a vector space over the reals. For a
function g : Rn → R and a family of functions F, let F +g def= {f +g : f ∈ F}.
Hypothesis classes that have a representation as POS (F + g) for some vector
space of functions F and some function g are called Dudley classes.
1. Show that for every g : Rn → R and every vector space of functions F as

deﬁned earlier, VCdim(POS (F + g)) = VCdim(POS (F)).

2. (**) For every linearly closed family of real valued functions F, the VC-
dimension of the corresponding class POS (F) equals the linear dimension
of F (as a vector space). Hint: Let f1, . . . , fd be a basis for the vector space
F. Consider the mapping x (cid:55)→ (f1(x), . . . , fd(x)) (from Rn to Rd). Note
that this mapping induces a matching between functions over Rn of the
form POS (f ) and homogeneous linear halfspaces in Rd (the VC-dimension
of the class of homogeneous linear halfspaces is analyzed in Chapter 9).

3. Show that each of the following classes can be represented as a Dudley

class:
1. The class HSn of halfspaces over Rn (see Chapter 9).
2. The class HHSn of all homogeneous halfspaces over Rn (see Chapter 9).

Nonuniform Learnability

The notions of PAC learnability discussed so far in the book allow the sample
sizes to depend on the accuracy and conﬁdence parameters, but they are uniform
with respect to the labeling rule and the underlying data distribution. Conse-
quently, classes that are learnable in that respect are limited (they must have
a ﬁnite VC-dimension, as stated by Theorem 6.7). In this chapter we consider
more relaxed, weaker notions of learnability. We discuss the usefulness of such
notions and provide characterization of the concept classes that are learnable
using these deﬁnitions.

We begin this discussion by deﬁning a notion of “nonuniform learnability” that
allows the sample size to depend on the hypothesis to which the learner is com-
pared. We then provide a characterization of nonuniform learnability and show
that nonuniform learnability is a strict relaxation of agnostic PAC learnability.
We also show that a suﬃcient condition for nonuniform learnability is that H is
a countable union of hypothesis classes, each of which enjoys the uniform con-
vergence property. These results will be proved in Section 7.2 by introducing a
new learning paradigm, which is called Structural Risk Minimization (SRM). In
Section 7.3 we specify the SRM paradigm for countable hypothesis classes, which
yields the Minimum Description Length (MDL) paradigm. The MDL paradigm
gives a formal justiﬁcation to a philosophical principle of induction called Oc-
cam’s razor. Next, in Section 7.4 we introduce consistency as an even weaker
notion of learnability. Finally, we discuss the signiﬁcance and usefulness of the
diﬀerent notions of learnability.

7.1

Nonuniform Learnability

“Nonuniform learnability” allows the sample size to be nonuniform with respect
to the diﬀerent hypotheses with which the learner is competing. We say that a
hypothesis h is (, δ)-competitive with another hypothesis h(cid:48) if, with probability
higher than (1 − δ),

LD(h) ≤ LD(h(cid:48)) + .

In PAC learnability, this notion of “competitiveness” is not very useful, as we
are looking for a hypothesis with an absolute low risk (in the realizable case) or

Nonuniform Learnability

with a low risk compared to the minimal risk achieved by hypotheses in our class
(in the agnostic case). Therefore, the sample size depends only on the accuracy
and conﬁdence parameters. In nonuniform learnability, however, we allow the
sample size to be of the form mH(, δ, h); namely, it depends also on the h with
which we are competing. Formally,
definition 7.1 A hypothesis class H is nonuniformly learnable if there exist a
learning algorithm, A, and a function mNULH : (0, 1)2×H → N such that, for every
, δ ∈ (0, 1) and for every h ∈ H, if m ≥ mNULH (, δ, h) then for every distribution
D, with probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of S ∼ Dm, it holds that

LD(A(S)) ≤ LD(h) + .

At this point it might be useful to recall the deﬁnition of agnostic PAC learn-
ability (Deﬁnition 3.3):
A hypothesis class H is agnostically PAC learnable if there exist a learning algo-
rithm, A, and a function mH : (0, 1)2 → N such that, for every , δ ∈ (0, 1) and
for every distribution D, if m ≥ mH(, δ), then with probability of at least 1 − δ
over the choice of S ∼ Dm it holds that

LD(A(S)) ≤ min
Note that this implies that for every h ∈ H

h(cid:48)∈H LD(h(cid:48)) + .

LD(A(S)) ≤ LD(h) + .

In both types of learnability, we require that the output hypothesis will be
(, δ)-competitive with every other hypothesis in the class. But the diﬀerence
between these two notions of learnability is the question of whether the sample
size m may depend on the hypothesis h to which the error of A(S) is compared.
Note that that nonuniform learnability is a relaxation of agnostic PAC learn-
ability. That is, if a class is agnostic PAC learnable then it is also nonuniformly
learnable.

7.1.1

Characterizing Nonuniform Learnability

Our goal now is to characterize nonuniform learnability. In the previous chapter
we have found a crisp characterization of PAC learnable classes, by showing
that a class of binary classiﬁers is agnostic PAC learnable if and only if its VC-
dimension is ﬁnite. In the following theorem we ﬁnd a diﬀerent characterization
for nonuniform learnable classes for the task of binary classiﬁcation.
theorem 7.2 A hypothesis class H of binary classiﬁers is nonuniformly learn-
able if and only if it is a countable union of agnostic PAC learnable hypothesis
classes.

The proof of Theorem 7.2 relies on the following result of independent interest:

7.2 Structural Risk Minimization

85

union of hypothesis classes, H =(cid:83)

theorem 7.3 Let H be a hypothesis class that can be written as a countable
n∈N Hn, where each Hn enjoys the uniform
convergence property. Then, H is nonuniformly learnable.

Recall that in Chapter 4 we have shown that uniform convergence is suﬃcient
for agnostic PAC learnability. Theorem 7.3 generalizes this result to nonuni-
form learnability. The proof of this theorem will be given in the next section by
introducing a new learning paradigm. We now turn to proving Theorem 7.2.

Proof of Theorem 7.2 First assume that H = (cid:83)

n∈N Hn where each Hn is ag-
nostic PAC learnable. Using the fundamental theorem of statistical learning, it
follows that each Hn has the uniform convergence property. Therefore, using
Theorem 7.3 we obtain that H is nonuniform learnable.
For the other direction, assume that H is nonuniform learnable using some
algorithm A. For every n ∈ N, let Hn = {h ∈ H : mNULH (1/8, 1/7, h) ≤ n}.
Clearly, H = ∪n∈NHn. In addition, using the deﬁnition of mNULH we know that
for any distribution D that satisﬁes the realizability assumption with respect to
Hn, with probability of at least 6/7 over S ∼ Dn we have that LD(A(S)) ≤ 1/8.
Using the fundamental theorem of statistical learning, this implies that the VC-
dimension of Hn must be ﬁnite, and therefore Hn is agnostic PAC learnable.

The following example shows that nonuniform learnability is a strict relax-
ation of agnostic PAC learnability; namely, there are hypothesis classes that are
nonuniform learnable but are not agnostic PAC learnable.

where p : R → R is a polynomial of degree n. Let H =(cid:83)

Example 7.1 Consider a binary classiﬁcation problem with the instance domain
being X = R. For every n ∈ N let Hn be the class of polynomial classiﬁers of
degree n; namely, Hn is the set of all classiﬁers of the form h(x) = sign(p(x))
n∈N Hn. Therefore, H is
the class of all polynomial classiﬁers over R. It is easy to verify that VCdim(H) =
∞ while VCdim(Hn) = n + 1 (see Exercise 12). Hence, H is not PAC learnable,
while on the basis of Theorem 7.3, H is nonuniformly learnable.

7.2

Structural Risk Minimization

we do so by ﬁrst assuming that H can be written as H = (cid:83)

So far, we have encoded our prior knowledge by specifying a hypothesis class
H, which we believe includes a good predictor for the learning task at hand.
Yet another way to express our prior knowledge is by specifying preferences over
hypotheses within H. In the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) paradigm,
n∈N Hn and then
specifying a weight function, w : N → [0, 1], which assigns a weight to each
hypothesis class, Hn, such that a higher weight reﬂects a stronger preference
for the hypothesis class. In this section we discuss how to learn with such prior
knowledge. In the next section we describe a couple of important weighting
schemes, including Minimum Description Length.

86

Nonuniform Learnability

Concretely, let H be a hypothesis class that can be written as H =(cid:83)

n∈N Hn.
For example, H may be the class of all polynomial classiﬁers where each Hn is
the class of polynomial classiﬁers of degree n (see Example 7.1). Assume that for
each n, the class Hn enjoys the uniform convergence property (see Deﬁnition 4.3
(, δ). Let us also deﬁne
in Chapter 4) with a sample complexity function mUCHn
the function n : N × (0, 1) → (0, 1) by

n(m, δ) = min{ ∈ (0, 1) : mUCHn

(, δ) ≤ m}.

(7.1)

In words, we have a ﬁxed sample size m, and we are interested in the lowest
possible upper bound on the gap between empirical and true risks achievable by
using a sample of m examples.

From the deﬁnitions of uniform convergence and n, it follows that for every
m and δ, with probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of S ∼ Dm we have
that

∀h ∈ Hn,

|LD(h) − LS(h)| ≤ n(m, δ).

Let w : N → [0, 1] be a function such that(cid:80)∞

(7.2)
n=1 w(n) ≤ 1. We refer to w as
a weight function over the hypothesis classes H1,H2, . . .. Such a weight function
can reﬂect the importance that the learner attributes to each hypothesis class,
or some measure of the complexity of diﬀerent hypothesis classes. If H is a ﬁnite
union of N hypothesis classes, one can simply assign the same weight of 1/N to
all hypothesis classes. This equal weighting corresponds to no a priori preference
to any hypothesis class. Of course, if one believes (as prior knowledge) that a
certain hypothesis class is more likely to contain the correct target function,
then it should be assigned a larger weight, reﬂecting this prior knowledge. When
H is a (countable) inﬁnite union of hypothesis classes, a uniform weighting is
not possible but many other weighting schemes may work. For example, one can
π2n2 or w(n) = 2−n. Later in this chapter we will provide another
choose w(n) = 6
convenient way to deﬁne weighting functions using description languages.

The SRM rule follows a “bound minimization” approach. This means that
the goal of the paradigm is to ﬁnd a hypothesis that minimizes a certain upper
bound on the true risk. The bound that the SRM rule wishes to minimize is
given in the following theorem.

theorem 7.4 Let w : N → [0, 1] be a function such that (cid:80)∞
H be a hypothesis class that can be written as H =(cid:83)

n=1 w(n) ≤ 1. Let
n∈N Hn, where for each n,
Hn satisﬁes the uniform convergence property with a sample complexity function
. Let n be as deﬁned in Equation (7.1). Then, for every δ ∈ (0, 1) and
mUCHn
distribution D, with probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of S ∼ Dm, the
following bound holds (simultaneously) for every n ∈ N and h ∈ Hn.

|LD(h) − LS(h)| ≤ n(m, w(n) · δ).

Therefore, for every δ ∈ (0, 1) and distribution D, with probability of at least

7.2 Structural Risk Minimization

87

1 − δ it holds that

∀h ∈ H, LD(h) ≤ LS(h) + min
n:h∈Hn

n(m, w(n) · δ).

(7.3)

Proof For each n deﬁne δn = w(n)δ. Applying the assumption that uniform
convergence holds for all n with the rate given in Equation (7.2), we obtain that
if we ﬁx n in advance, then with probability of at least 1 − δn over the choice of
S ∼ Dm,

|LD(h) − LS(h)| ≤ n(m, δn).

at least 1 −(cid:80)

∀h ∈ Hn,

n δn = 1 − δ(cid:80)

Applying the union bound over n = 1, 2, . . ., we obtain that with probability of
n w(n) ≥ 1 − δ, the preceding holds for all n, which

concludes our proof.

Denote

n(h) = min{n : h ∈ Hn},

(7.4)

and then Equation (7.3) implies that

LD(h) ≤ LS(h) + n(h)(m, w(n(h)) · δ).

The SRM paradigm searches for h that minimizes this bound, as formalized

in the following pseudocode:

Unlike the ERM paradigm discussed in previous chapters, we no longer just care
about the empirical risk, LS(h), but we are willing to trade some of our bias
toward low empirical risk with a bias toward classes for which n(h)(m, w(n(h))·δ)
is smaller, for the sake of a smaller estimation error.

Next we show that the SRM paradigm can be used for nonuniform learning
of every class, which is a countable union of uniformly converging hypothesis
classes.

(cid:2)LS(h(cid:48)) + n(h(cid:48))(m, w(n(h(cid:48)))δ)(cid:3) ≤ LS(h) + n(h)(m, w(n(h))δ).

The preceding holds in particular for the hypothesis A(S) returned by the SRM
rule. By the deﬁnition of SRM we obtain that
LD(A(S)) ≤ min
h(cid:48)
Finally, if m ≥ mUCHn(h)
(/2, w(n(h))δ) then clearly n(h)(m, w(n(h))δ) ≤ /2. In
addition, from the uniform convergence property of each Hn we have that with
probability of more than 1 − δ,

LS(h) ≤ LD(h) + /2.

Combining all the preceding we obtain that LD(A(S)) ≤ LD(h) + , which con-
cludes our proof.

Note that the previous theorem also proves Theorem 7.3.

Remark 7.2 (No-Free-Lunch for Nonuniform Learnability) We have shown that
any countable union of classes of ﬁnite VC-dimension is nonuniformly learnable.
It turns out that, for any inﬁnite domain set, X , the class of all binary valued
functions over X is not a countable union of classes of ﬁnite VC-dimension. We
leave the proof of this claim as a (nontrivial) exercise (see Exercise 5). It follows
that, in some sense, the no free lunch theorem holds for nonuniform learning
as well: namely, whenever the domain is not ﬁnite, there exists no nonuniform
learner with respect to the class of all deterministic binary classiﬁers (although
for each such classiﬁer there exists a trivial algorithm that learns it – ERM with
respect to the hypothesis class that contains only this classiﬁer).

It is interesting to compare the nonuniform learnability result given in The-
orem 7.5 to the task of agnostic PAC learning any speciﬁc Hn separately. The
prior knowledge, or bias, of a nonuniform learner for H is weaker – it is searching
for a model throughout the entire class H, rather than being focused on one spe-
ciﬁc Hn. The cost of this weakening of prior knowledge is the increase in sample
complexity needed to compete with any speciﬁc h ∈ Hn. For a concrete evalua-
tion of this gap, consider the task of binary classiﬁcation with the zero-one loss.
Assume that for all n, VCdim(Hn) = n. Since mUCHn

C is the contant appearing in Theorem 6.8), a straightforward calculation shows
that

That is, the cost of relaxing the learner’s prior knowledge from a speciﬁc Hn

the index of the ﬁrst class in which h resides. That cost increases with the index

Let H be a countable hypothesis class. Then, we can write H as a countable
n∈N{hn}. By Hoeﬀding’s inequality
(Lemma 4.5), each singleton class has the uniform convergence property with
rate mUC(, δ) = log(2/δ)
. Therefore, the function n given in Equation (7.1)

becomes n(m, δ) =

It follows that in this case, the prior knowledge is solely determined by the weight
we assign to each hypothesis. We assign higher weights to hypotheses that we
believe are more likely to be the correct one, and in the learning algorithm we
prefer hypotheses that have higher weights.

In this section we discuss a particular convenient way to deﬁne a weight func-
tion over H, which is derived from the length of descriptions given to hypotheses.
Having a hypothesis class, one can wonder about how we describe, or represent,
each hypothesis in the class. We naturally ﬁx some description language. This
can be English, or a programming language, or some set of mathematical formu-
las. In any of these languages, a description consists of ﬁnite strings of symbols
(or characters) drawn from some ﬁxed alphabet. We shall now formalize these
notions.

Let H be the hypothesis class we wish to describe. Fix some ﬁnite set Σ
of symbols (or “characters”), which we call the alphabet. For concreteness, we
let Σ = {0, 1}. A string is a ﬁnite sequence of symbols from Σ; for example,
σ = (0, 1, 1, 1, 0) is a string of length 5. We denote by |σ| the length of a string.
The set of all ﬁnite length strings is denoted Σ∗. A description language for H
is a function d : H → Σ∗, mapping each member h of H to a string d(h). d(h) is
called “the description of h,” and its length is denoted by |h|.

We shall require that description languages be preﬁx-free; namely, for every
distinct h, h(cid:48), d(h) is not a preﬁx of d(h(cid:48)). That is, we do not allow that any
string d(h) is exactly the ﬁrst |h| symbols of any longer string d(h(cid:48)). Preﬁx-free
collections of strings enjoy the following combinatorial property:

lemma 7.6 (Kraft Inequality)

If S ⊆ {0, 1}∗ is a preﬁx-free set of strings, then

(cid:88)

σ∈S

2|σ| ≤ 1.

Proof Deﬁne a probability distribution over the members of S as follows: Re-
peatedly toss an unbiased coin, with faces labeled 0 and 1, until the sequence
of outcomes is a member of S; at that point, stop. For each σ ∈ S, let P (σ)
be the probability that this process generates the string σ. Note that since S is
preﬁx-free, for every σ ∈ S, if the coin toss outcomes follow the bits of σ then
we will stop only once the sequence of outcomes equals σ. We therefore get that,
for every σ ∈ S, P (σ) = 1
2|σ| . Since probabilities add up to at most 1, our proof
is concluded.

In light of Kraft’s inequality, any preﬁx-free description language of a hypoth-
esis class, H, gives rise to a weighting function w over that hypothesis class – we
will simply set w(h) = 1
2|h| . This observation immediately yields the following:
theorem 7.7 Let H be a hypothesis class and let d : H → {0, 1}∗ be a preﬁx-
free description language for H. Then, for every sample size, m, every conﬁdence
parameter, δ > 0, and every probability distribution, D, with probability greater
than 1 − δ over the choice of S ∼ Dm we have that,

(cid:114)|h| + ln(2/δ)

∀h ∈ H, LD(h) ≤ LS(h) +

where |h| is the length of d(h).
Proof Choose w(h) = 1/2|h|, apply Theorem 7.4 with n(m, δ) =

As was the case with Theorem 7.4, this result suggests a learning paradigm
for H – given a training set, S, search for a hypothesis h ∈ H that minimizes
the bound, LS(h) +
. In particular, it suggests trading oﬀ empirical
risk for saving description length. This yields the Minimum Description Length

binary string obtained by running the gzip command on the program (this yields
a preﬁx-free description language over the alphabet {0, 1}). Then, |h| is simply
the length (in bits) of the output of gzip when running on the C++ program
corresponding to h.

7.3.1

Occam’s Razor

Theorem 7.7 suggests that, having two hypotheses sharing the same empirical
risk, the true risk of the one that has shorter description can be bounded by a
lower value. Thus, this result can be viewed as conveying a philosophical message:

A short explanation (that is, a hypothesis that has a short length) tends to be more valid
than a long explanation.

This is a well known principle, called Occam’s razor, after William of Ockham,
a 14th-century English logician, who is believed to have been the ﬁrst to phrase
it explicitly. Here, we provide one possible justiﬁcation to this principle. The
inequality of Theorem 7.7 shows that the more complex a hypothesis h is (in the
sense of having a longer description), the larger the sample size it has to ﬁt to
guarantee that it has a small true risk, LD(h).

At a second glance, our Occam razor claim might seem somewhat problematic.
In the context in which the Occam razor principle is usually invoked in science,
the language according to which complexity is measured is a natural language,
whereas here we may consider any arbitrary abstract description language. As-
sume that we have two hypotheses such that |h(cid:48)| is much smaller than |h|. By
the preceding result, if both have the same error on a given training set, S, then
the true error of h may be much higher than the true error of h(cid:48), so one should
prefer h(cid:48) over h. However, we could have chosen a diﬀerent description language,
say, one that assigns a string of length 3 to h and a string of length 100000 to h(cid:48).
Suddenly it looks as if one should prefer h over h(cid:48). But these are the same h and
h(cid:48) for which we argued two sentences ago that h(cid:48) should be preferable. Where is
the catch here?

(cid:113) ln(2/δ)

Indeed, there is no inherent generalizability diﬀerence between hypotheses.
The crucial aspect here is the dependency order between the initial choice of
language (or, preference over hypotheses) and the training set. As we know from
the basic Hoeﬀding’s bound (Equation (4.2)), if we commit to any hypothesis be-
fore seeing the data, then we are guaranteed a rather small estimation error term
LD(h) ≤ LS(h) +
2m . Choosing a description language (or, equivalently,
some weighting of hypotheses) is a weak form of committing to a hypothesis.
Rather than committing to a single hypothesis, we spread out our commitment
among many. As long as it is done independently of the training sample, our gen-
eralization bound holds. Just as the choice of a single hypothesis to be evaluated
by a sample can be arbitrary, so is the choice of description language.

Nonuniform Learnability

7.4

Other Notions of Learnability – Consistency

The notion of learnability can be further relaxed by allowing the needed sample
sizes to depend not only on , δ, and h but also on the underlying data-generating
probability distribution D (that is used to generate the training sample and to
determine the risk). This type of performance guarantee is captured by the notion
of consistency 1 of a learning rule.
definition 7.8 (Consistency) Let Z be a domain set, let P be a set of
probability distributions over Z, and let H be a hypothesis class. A learn-
ing rule A is consistent with respect to H and P if there exists a function
mCONH : (0, 1)2 × H × P → N such that, for every , δ ∈ (0, 1), every h ∈ H, and
every D ∈ P, if m ≥ mNULH (, δ, h,D) then with probability of at least 1 − δ over
the choice of S ∼ Dm it holds that

LD(A(S)) ≤ LD(h) + .

If P is the set of all distributions,2 we say that A is universally consistent with
respect to H.

The notion of consistency is, of course, a relaxation of our previous notion
of nonuniform learnability. Clearly if an algorithm nonuniformly learns a class
H it is also universally consistent for that class. The relaxation is strict in the
sense that there are consistent learning rules that are not successful nonuniform
learners. For example, the algorithm Memorize deﬁned in Example 7.4 later is
universally consistent for the class of all binary classiﬁers over N. However, as
we have argued before, this class is not nonuniformly learnable.

Example 7.4 Consider the classiﬁcation prediction algorithm Memorize deﬁned
as follows. The algorithm memorizes the training examples, and, given a test
point x, it predicts the majority label among all labeled instances of x that exist
in the training sample (and some ﬁxed default label if no instance of x appears
in the training set). It is possible to show (see Exercise 6) that the Memorize
algorithm is universally consistent for every countable domain X and a ﬁnite
label set Y (w.r.t. the zero-one loss).

Intuitively, it is not obvious that the Memorize algorithm should be viewed as a
learner, since it lacks the aspect of generalization, namely, of using observed data
to predict the labels of unseen examples. The fact that Memorize is a consistent
algorithm for the class of all functions over any countable domain set therefore
raises doubt about the usefulness of consistency guarantees. Furthermore, the
sharp-eyed reader may notice that the “bad learner” we introduced in Chapter 2,

1 In the literature, consistency is often deﬁned using the notion of either convergence in

probability (corresponding to weak consistency) or almost sure convergence (corresponding
to strong consistency).

2 Formally, we assume that Z is endowed with some sigma algebra of subsets Ω, and by “all

distributions” we mean all probability distributions that have Ω contained in their
associated family of measurable subsets.

7.5 Discussing the Diﬀerent Notions of Learnability

93

which led to overﬁtting, is in fact the Memorize algorithm. In the next section
we discuss the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerent notions of learnability and revisit the
No-Free-Lunch theorem in light of the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of learnability.

7.5

Discussing the Diﬀerent Notions of Learnability

We have given three deﬁnitions of learnability and we now discuss their useful-
ness. As is usually the case, the usefulness of a mathematical deﬁnition depends
on what we need it for. We therefore list several possible goals that we aim to
achieve by deﬁning learnability and discuss the usefulness of the diﬀerent deﬁni-
tions in light of these goals.

What Is the Risk of the Learned Hypothesis?
The ﬁrst possible goal of deriving performance guarantees on a learning algo-
rithm is bounding the risk of the output predictor. Here, both PAC learning
and nonuniform learning give us an upper bound on the true risk of the learned
hypothesis based on its empirical risk. Consistency guarantees do not provide
such a bound. However, it is always possible to estimate the risk of the output
predictor using a validation set (as will be described in Chapter 11).

How Many Examples Are Required to Be as Good as the Best Hypothesis
in H?
When approaching a learning problem, a natural question is how many exam-
ples we need to collect in order to learn it. Here, PAC learning gives a crisp
answer. However, for both nonuniform learning and consistency, we do not know
in advance how many examples are required to learn H. In nonuniform learning
this number depends on the best hypothesis in H, and in consistency it also
depends on the underlying distribution. In this sense, PAC learning is the only
useful deﬁnition of learnability. On the ﬂip side, one should keep in mind that
even if the estimation error of the predictor we learn is small, its risk may still
be large if H has a large approximation error. So, for the question “How many
examples are required to be as good as the Bayes optimal predictor?” even PAC
guarantees do not provide us with a crisp answer. This reﬂects the fact that the
usefulness of PAC learning relies on the quality of our prior knowledge.

PAC guarantees also help us to understand what we should do next if our
learning algorithm returns a hypothesis with a large risk, since we can bound
the part of the error that stems from estimation error and therefore know how
much of the error is attributed to approximation error. If the approximation error
is large, we know that we should use a diﬀerent hypothesis class. Similarly, if a
nonuniform algorithm fails, we can consider a diﬀerent weighting function over
(subsets of) hypotheses. However, when a consistent algorithm fails, we have
no idea whether this is because of the estimation error or the approximation
error. Furthermore, even if we are sure we have a problem with the estimation

94

Nonuniform Learnability

error term, we do not know how many more examples are needed to make the
estimation error small.

How to Learn? How to Express Prior Knowledge?
Maybe the most useful aspect of the theory of learning is in providing an answer
to the question of “how to learn.” The deﬁnition of PAC learning yields the
limitation of learning (via the No-Free-Lunch theorem) and the necessity of prior
knowledge. It gives us a crisp way to encode prior knowledge by choosing a
hypothesis class, and once this choice is made, we have a generic learning rule –
ERM. The deﬁnition of nonuniform learnability also yields a crisp way to encode
prior knowledge by specifying weights over (subsets of) hypotheses of H. Once
this choice is made, we again have a generic learning rule – SRM. The SRM rule
is also advantageous in model selection tasks, where prior knowledge is partial.
We elaborate on model selection in Chapter 11 and here we give a brief example.
Consider the problem of ﬁtting a one dimensional polynomial to data; namely,
our goal is to learn a function, h : R → R, and as prior knowledge we consider
the hypothesis class of polynomials. However, we might be uncertain regarding
which degree d would give the best results for our data set: A small degree might
not ﬁt the data well (i.e., it will have a large approximation error), whereas a
high degree might lead to overﬁtting (i.e., it will have a large estimation error).
In the following we depict the result of ﬁtting a polynomial of degrees 2, 3, and
10 to the same training set.

degree 2

degree 3

degree 10

It is easy to see that the empirical risk decreases as we enlarge the degree.
Therefore, if we choose H to be the class of all polynomials up to degree 10 then
the ERM rule with respect to this class would output a 10 degree polynomial
and would overﬁt. On the other hand, if we choose too small a hypothesis class,
say, polynomials up to degree 2, then the ERM would suﬀer from underﬁtting
(i.e., a large approximation error). In contrast, we can use the SRM rule on the
set of all polynomials, while ordering subsets of H according to their degree, and
this will yield a 3rd degree polynomial since the combination of its empirical
risk and the bound on its estimation error is the smallest. In other words, the
SRM rule enables us to select the right model on the basis of the data itself. The
price we pay for this ﬂexibility (besides a slight increase of the estimation error
relative to PAC learning w.r.t. the optimal degree) is that we do not know in

7.5 Discussing the Diﬀerent Notions of Learnability

95

advance how many examples are needed to compete with the best hypothesis in
H.

Unlike the notions of PAC learnability and nonuniform learnability, the deﬁni-
tion of consistency does not yield a natural learning paradigm or a way to encode
prior knowledge. In fact, in many cases there is no need for prior knowledge at
all. For example, we saw that even the Memorize algorithm, which intuitively
should not be called a learning algorithm, is a consistent algorithm for any class
deﬁned over a countable domain and a ﬁnite label set. This hints that consistency
is a very weak requirement.

Which Learning Algorithm Should We Prefer?
One may argue that even though consistency is a weak requirement, it is desirable
that a learning algorithm will be consistent with respect to the set of all functions
from X to Y, which gives us a guarantee that for enough training examples, we
will always be as good as the Bayes optimal predictor. Therefore, if we have
two algorithms, where one is consistent and the other one is not consistent, we
should prefer the consistent algorithm. However, this argument is problematic for
two reasons. First, maybe it is the case that for most “natural” distributions we
will observe in practice that the sample complexity of the consistent algorithm
will be so large so that in every practical situation we will not obtain enough
examples to enjoy this guarantee. Second, it is not very hard to make any PAC
or nonuniform learner consistent with respect to the class of all functions from
X to Y. Concretely, consider a countable domain, X , a ﬁnite label set Y, and
a hypothesis class, H, of functions from X to Y. We can make any nonuniform
learner for H be consistent with respect to the class of all classiﬁers from X to Y
using the following simple trick: Upon receiving a training set, we will ﬁrst run
the nonuniform learner over the training set, and then we will obtain a bound
on the true risk of the learned predictor. If this bound is small enough we are
done. Otherwise, we revert to the Memorize algorithm. This simple modiﬁcation
makes the algorithm consistent with respect to all functions from X to Y. Since
it is easy to make any algorithm consistent, it may not be wise to prefer one
algorithm over the other just because of consistency considerations.

7.5.1

The No-Free-Lunch Theorem Revisited

Recall that the No-Free-Lunch theorem (Theorem 5.1 from Chapter 5) implies
that no algorithm can learn the class of all classiﬁers over an inﬁnite domain.
In contrast, in this chapter we saw that the Memorize algorithm is consistent
with respect to the class of all classiﬁers over a countable inﬁnite domain. To
understand why these two statements do not contradict each other, let us ﬁrst
recall the formal statement of the No-Free-Lunch theorem.
Let X be a countable inﬁnite domain and let Y = {±1}. The No-Free-Lunch
theorem implies the following: For any algorithm, A, and a training set size, m,
there exist a distribution over X and a function h(cid:63) : X → Y, such that if A

96

Nonuniform Learnability

will get a sample of m i.i.d. training examples, labeled by h(cid:63), then A is likely to
return a classiﬁer with a larger error.

The consistency of Memorize implies the following: For every distribution over
X and a labeling function h(cid:63) : X → Y, there exists a training set size m (that
depends on the distribution and on h(cid:63)) such that if Memorize receives at least
m examples it is likely to return a classiﬁer with a small error.

We see that in the No-Free-Lunch theorem, we ﬁrst ﬁx the training set size,
and then ﬁnd a distribution and a labeling function that are bad for this training
set size. In contrast, in consistency guarantees, we ﬁrst ﬁx the distribution and
the labeling function, and only then do we ﬁnd a training set size that suﬃces
for learning this particular distribution and labeling function.

7.6

Summary

We introduced nonuniform learnability as a relaxation of PAC learnability and
consistency as a relaxation of nonuniform learnability. This means that even
classes of inﬁnite VC-dimension can be learnable, in some weaker sense of learn-
ability. We discussed the usefulness of the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of learnability.

For hypothesis classes that are countable, we can apply the Minimum Descrip-
tion Length scheme, where hypotheses with shorter descriptions are preferred,
following the principle of Occam’s razor. An interesting example is the hypothe-
sis class of all predictors we can implement in C++ (or any other programming
language), which we can learn (nonuniformly) using the MDL scheme.

Arguably, the class of all predictors we can implement in C++ is a powerful
class of functions and probably contains all that we can hope to learn in prac-
tice. The ability to learn this class is impressive, and, seemingly, this chapter
should have been the last chapter of this book. This is not the case, because of
the computational aspect of learning: that is, the runtime needed to apply the
learning rule. For example, to implement the MDL paradigm with respect to
all C++ programs, we need to perform an exhaustive search over all C++ pro-
grams, which will take forever. Even the implementation of the ERM paradigm
with respect to all C++ programs of description length at most 1000 bits re-
quires an exhaustive search over 21000 hypotheses. While the sample complexity
, the runtime is ≥ 21000. This is a huge
of learning this class is just 1000+log(2/δ)
number – much larger than the number of atoms in the visible universe. In the
next chapter we formally deﬁne the computational complexity of learning. In the
second part of this book we will study hypothesis classes for which the ERM or
SRM schemes can be implemented eﬃciently.

Bibliographic Remarks

Our deﬁnition of nonuniform learnability is related to the deﬁnition of an Occam-
algorithm in Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler & Warmuth (1987). The concept of
SRM is due to (Vapnik & Chervonenkis 1974, Vapnik 1995). The concept of MDL
is due to (Rissanen 1978, Rissanen 1983). The relation between SRM and MDL
is discussed in Vapnik (1995). These notions are also closely related to the notion
of regularization (e.g. Tikhonov (1943)). We will elaborate on regularization in
the second part of this book.

The notion of consistency of estimators dates back to Fisher (1922). Our pre-
sentation of consistency follows Steinwart & Christmann (2008), who also derived
several no-free-lunch theorems.

there exists a function mNULH : (0, 1)2×H → N such that, for every , δ ∈ (0, 1)
and for every h ∈ H, if m ≥ mNULH (, δ, h) then for every distribution D, with

The Runtime of Learning

So far in the book we have studied the statistical perspective of learning, namely,
how many samples are needed for learning. In other words, we focused on the
amount of information learning requires. However, when considering automated
learning, computational resources also play a major role in determining the com-
plexity of a task: that is, how much computation is involved in carrying out a
learning task. Once a suﬃcient training sample is available to the learner, there
is some computation to be done to extract a hypothesis or ﬁgure out the label of
a given test instance. These computational resources are crucial in any practical
application of machine learning. We refer to these two types of resources as the
sample complexity and the computational complexity. In this chapter, we turn
our attention to the computational complexity of learning.

The computational complexity of learning should be viewed in the wider con-
text of the computational complexity of general algorithmic tasks. This area has
been extensively investigated; see, for example, (Sipser 2006). The introductory
comments that follow summarize the basic ideas of that general theory that are
most relevant to our discussion.

The actual runtime (in seconds) of an algorithm depends on the speciﬁc ma-
chine the algorithm is being implemented on (e.g., what the clock rate of the
machine’s CPU is). To avoid dependence on the speciﬁc machine, it is common
to analyze the runtime of algorithms in an asymptotic sense. For example, we
say that the computational complexity of the merge-sort algorithm, which sorts
a list of n items, is O(n log(n)). This implies that we can implement the algo-
rithm on any machine that satisﬁes the requirements of some accepted abstract
model of computation, and the actual runtime in seconds will satisfy the follow-
ing: there exist constants c and n0, which can depend on the actual machine,
such that, for any value of n > n0, the runtime in seconds of sorting any n items
will be at most c n log(n). It is common to use the term feasible or eﬃciently
computable for tasks that can be performed by an algorithm whose running time
is O(p(n)) for some polynomial function p. One should note that this type of
analysis depends on deﬁning what is the input size n of any instance to which
the algorithm is expected to be applied. For “purely algorithmic” tasks, as dis-
cussed in the common computational complexity literature, this input size is
clearly deﬁned; the algorithm gets an input instance, say, a list to be sorted, or
an arithmetic operation to be calculated, which has a well deﬁned size (say, the

number of bits in its representation). For machine learning tasks, the notion of
an input size is not so clear. An algorithm aims to detect some pattern in a data
set and can only access random samples of that data.

We start the chapter by discussing this issue and deﬁne the computational
complexity of learning. For advanced students, we also provide a detailed formal
deﬁnition. We then move on to consider the computational complexity of im-
plementing the ERM rule. We ﬁrst give several examples of hypothesis classes
where the ERM rule can be eﬃciently implemented, and then consider some
cases where, although the class is indeed eﬃciently learnable, ERM implemen-
tation is computationally hard. It follows that hardness of implementing ERM
does not imply hardness of learning. Finally, we brieﬂy discuss how one can show
hardness of a given learning task, namely, that no learning algorithm can solve
it eﬃciently.

8.1

Computational Complexity of Learning

Recall that a learning algorithm has access to a domain of examples, Z, a hy-
pothesis class, H, a loss function, (cid:96), and a training set of examples from Z that
are sampled i.i.d. according to an unknown distribution D. Given parameters
, δ, the algorithm should output a hypothesis h such that with probability of
at least 1 − δ,

LD(h) ≤ min

h(cid:48)∈H LD(h(cid:48)) + .

As mentioned before, the actual runtime of an algorithm in seconds depends on
the speciﬁc machine. To allow machine independent analysis, we use the standard
approach in computational complexity theory. First, we rely on a notion of an
abstract machine, such as a Turing machine (or a Turing machine over the reals
(Blum, Shub & Smale 1989)). Second, we analyze the runtime in an asymptotic
sense, while ignoring constant factors, thus the speciﬁc machine is not important
as long as it implements the abstract machine. Usually, the asymptote is with
respect to the size of the input to the algorithm. For example, for the merge-sort
algorithm mentioned before, we analyze the runtime as a function of the number
of items that need to be sorted.

In the context of learning algorithms, there is no clear notion of “input size.”
One might deﬁne the input size to be the size of the training set the algorithm
receives, but that would be rather pointless. If we give the algorithm a very
large number of examples, much larger than the sample complexity of the learn-
ing problem, the algorithm can simply ignore the extra examples. Therefore, a
larger training set does not make the learning problem more diﬃcult, and, con-
sequently, the runtime available for a learning algorithm should not increase as
we increase the size of the training set. Just the same, we can still analyze the
runtime as a function of natural parameters of the problem such as the target
accuracy, the conﬁdence of achieving that accuracy, the dimensionality of the

102

The Runtime of Learning

domain set, or some measures of the complexity of the hypothesis class with
which the algorithm’s output is compared.

To illustrate this, consider a learning algorithm for the task of learning axis
aligned rectangles. A speciﬁc problem of learning axis aligned rectangles is de-
rived by specifying , δ, and the dimension of the instance space. We can deﬁne a
sequence of problems of the type “rectangles learning” by ﬁxing , δ and varying
the dimension to be d = 2, 3, 4, . . .. We can also deﬁne another sequence of “rect-
angles learning” problems by ﬁxing d, δ and varying the target accuracy to be
 = 1
3 , . . .. One can of course choose other sequences of such problems. Once
a sequence of the problems is ﬁxed, one can analyze the asymptotic runtime as
a function of variables of that sequence.

2 , 1

Before we introduce the formal deﬁnition, there is one more subtlety we need
to tackle. On the basis of the preceding, a learning algorithm can “cheat,” by
transferring the computational burden to the output hypothesis. For example,
the algorithm can simply deﬁne the output hypothesis to be the function that
stores the training set in its memory, and whenever it gets a test example x
it calculates the ERM hypothesis on the training set and applies it on x. Note
that in this case, our algorithm has a ﬁxed output (namely, the function that
we have just described) and can run in constant time. However, learning is still
hard – the hardness is now in implementing the output classiﬁer to obtain a
label prediction. To prevent this “cheating,” we shall require that the output of
a learning algorithm must be applied to predict the label of a new example in
time that does not exceed the runtime of training (that is, computing the output
classiﬁer from the input training sample). In the next subsection the advanced
reader may ﬁnd a formal deﬁnition of the computational complexity of learning.

8.1.1

Formal Deﬁnition*

The deﬁnition that follows relies on a notion of an underlying abstract machine,
which is usually either a Turing machine or a Turing machine over the reals. We
will measure the computational complexity of an algorithm using the number of
“operations” it needs to perform, where we assume that for any machine that
implements the underlying abstract machine there exists a constant c such that
any such “operation” can be performed on the machine using c seconds.

definition 8.1 (The Computational Complexity of a Learning Algorithm)
We deﬁne the complexity of learning in two steps. First we consider the compu-
tational complexity of a ﬁxed learning problem (determined by a triplet (Z,H, (cid:96))
– a domain set, a benchmark hypothesis class, and a loss function). Then, in the
second step we consider the rate of change of that complexity along a sequence
of such tasks.
1. Given a function f : (0, 1)2 → N, a learning task (Z,H, (cid:96)), and a learning
algorithm, A, we say that A solves the learning task in time O(f ) if there
exists some constant number c, such that for every probability distribution D

by D,
• A terminates after performing at most cf (, δ) operations
• The output of A, denoted hA, can be applied to predict the label of a new
• The output of A is probably approximately correct; namely, with proba-
bility of at least 1 − δ (over the random samples A receives), LD(hA) ≤

example while performing at most cf (, δ) operations

2. Consider a sequence of learning problems, (Zn,Hn, (cid:96)n)∞

n=1, where problem n
is deﬁned by a domain Zn, a hypothesis class Hn, and a loss function (cid:96)n.
Let A be a learning algorithm designed for solving learning problems of
this form. Given a function g : N × (0, 1)2 → N, we say that the runtime of
A with respect to the preceding sequence is O(g), if for all n, A solves the
problem (Zn,Hn, (cid:96)n) in time O(fn), where fn : (0, 1)2 → N is deﬁned by
fn(, δ) = g(n, , δ).
We say that A is an eﬃcient algorithm with respect to a sequence (Zn,Hn, (cid:96)n)

if its runtime is O(p(n, 1/, 1/δ)) for some polynomial p.

From this deﬁnition we see that the question whether a general learning prob-
lem can be solved eﬃciently depends on how it can be broken into a sequence
of speciﬁc learning problems. For example, consider the problem of learning a
ﬁnite hypothesis class. As we showed in previous chapters, the ERM rule over
H is guaranteed to (, δ)-learn H if the number of training examples is order of
mH(, δ) = log(|H|/δ)/2. Assuming that the evaluation of a hypothesis on an
example takes a constant time, it is possible to implement the ERM rule in time
O(|H| mH(, δ)) by performing an exhaustive search over H with a training set
of size mH(, δ). For any ﬁxed ﬁnite H, the exhaustive search algorithm runs
in polynomial time. Furthermore, if we deﬁne a sequence of problems in which
|Hn| = n, then the exhaustive search is still considered to be eﬃcient. However, if
we deﬁne a sequence of problems for which |Hn| = 2n, then the sample complex-
ity is still polynomial in n but the computational complexity of the exhaustive
search algorithm grows exponentially with n (thus, rendered ineﬃcient).

8.2

Implementing the ERM Rule
Given a hypothesis class H, the ERMH rule is maybe the most natural learning
paradigm. Furthermore, for binary classiﬁcation problems we saw that if learning
is at all possible, it is possible with the ERM rule. In this section we discuss the
computational complexity of implementing the ERM rule for several hypothesis
classes.

Given a hypothesis class, H, a domain set Z, and a loss function (cid:96), the corre-

sponding ERMH rule can be deﬁned as follows:

104

The Runtime of Learning

On a ﬁnite input sample S ∈ Zm output some h ∈ H that minimizes the empirical loss,
LS(h) = 1|S|

z∈S (cid:96)(h, z).

(cid:80)

This section studies the runtime of implementing the ERM rule for several

examples of learning tasks.

8.2.1

Finite Classes

Limiting the hypothesis class to be a ﬁnite class may be considered as a reason-
ably mild restriction. For example, H can be the set of all predictors that can be
implemented by a C++ program written in at most 10000 bits of code. Other ex-
amples of useful ﬁnite classes are any hypothesis class that can be parameterized
by a ﬁnite number of parameters, where we are satisﬁed with a representation
of each of the parameters using a ﬁnite number of bits, for example, the class of
axis aligned rectangles in the Euclidean space, Rd, when the parameters deﬁning
any given rectangle are speciﬁed up to some limited precision.
As we have shown in previous chapters, the sample complexity of learning a
ﬁnite class is upper bounded by mH(, δ) = c log(c|H|/δ)/c, where c = 1 in
the realizable case and c = 2 in the nonrealizable case. Therefore, the sample
complexity has a mild dependence on the size of H. In the example of C++
programs mentioned before, the number of hypotheses is 210,000 but the sample
complexity is only c(10, 000 + log(c/δ))/c.

A straightforward approach for implementing the ERM rule over a ﬁnite hy-
pothesis class is to perform an exhaustive search. That is, for each h ∈ H we
calculate the empirical risk, LS(h), and return a hypothesis that minimizes
the empirical risk. Assuming that the evaluation of (cid:96)(h, z) on a single exam-
ple takes a constant amount of time, k, the runtime of this exhaustive search
becomes k|H|m, where m is the size of the training set. If we let m to be the
upper bound on the sample complexity mentioned, then the runtime becomes
k|H|c log(c|H|/δ)/c.

The linear dependence of the runtime on the size of H makes this approach
ineﬃcient (and unrealistic) for large classes. Formally, if we deﬁne a sequence of
n=1 such that log(|Hn|) = n, then the exhaustive search
problems (Zn,Hn, (cid:96)n)∞
approach yields an exponential runtime. In the example of C++ programs, if Hn
is the set of functions that can be implemented by a C++ program written in
at most n bits of code, then the runtime grows exponentially with n, implying
that the exhaustive search approach is unrealistic for practical use. In fact, this
problem is one of the reasons we are dealing with other hypothesis classes, like
classes of linear predictors, which we will encounter in the next chapter, and not
just focusing on ﬁnite classes.

It is important to realize that the ineﬃciency of one algorithmic approach
(such as the exhaustive search) does not yet imply that no eﬃcient ERM imple-
mentation exists. Indeed, we will show examples in which the ERM rule can be
implemented eﬃciently.

Eﬃciently Learnable in the Realizable Case
Consider implementing the ERM rule in the realizable case. That is, we are given
a training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym) of examples, such that there exists an
axis aligned rectangle, h ∈ Hn, for which h(xi) = yi for all i. Our goal is to ﬁnd
such an axis aligned rectangle with a zero training error, namely, a rectangle
that is consistent with all the labels in S.
We show later that this can be done in time O(nm). Indeed, for each i ∈ [n],
set ai = min{xi : (x, 1) ∈ S} and bi = max{xi : (x, 1) ∈ S}. In words, we take
ai to be the minimal value of the i’th coordinate of a positive example in S and
bi to be the maximal value of the i’th coordinate of a positive example in S.
It is easy to verify that the resulting rectangle has zero training error and that
the runtime of ﬁnding each ai and bi is O(m). Hence, the total runtime of this
procedure is O(nm).

Not Eﬃciently Learnable in the Agnostic Case
In the agnostic case, we do not assume that some hypothesis h perfectly predicts
the labels of all the examples in the training set. Our goal is therefore to ﬁnd
h that minimizes the number of examples for which yi (cid:54)= h(xi). It turns out
that for many common hypothesis classes, including the classes of axis aligned
rectangles we consider here, solving the ERM problem in the agnostic setting is
NP-hard (and, in most cases, it is even NP-hard to ﬁnd some h ∈ H whose error
is no more than some constant c > 1 times that of the empirical risk minimizer
in H). That is, unless P = NP, there is no algorithm whose running time is
polynomial in m and n that is guaranteed to ﬁnd an ERM hypothesis for these
problems (Ben-David, Eiron & Long 2003).

On the other hand, it is worthwhile noticing that, if we ﬁx one speciﬁc hypoth-
esis class, say, axis aligned rectangles in some ﬁxed dimension, n, then there exist
eﬃcient learning algorithms for this class. In other words, there are successful
agnostic PAC learners that run in time polynomial in 1/ and 1/δ (but their
dependence on the dimension n is not polynomial).

To see this, recall the implementation of the ERM rule we presented for the
realizable case, from which it follows that an axis aligned rectangle is determined
by at most 2n examples. Therefore, given a training set of size m, we can per-
form an exhaustive search over all subsets of the training set of size at most 2n
examples and construct a rectangle from each such subset. Then, we can pick

106

The Runtime of Learning

the rectangle with the minimal training error. This procedure is guaranteed to
ﬁnd an ERM hypothesis, and the runtime of the procedure is mO(n). It follows
that if n is ﬁxed, the runtime is polynomial in the sample size. This does not
contradict the aforementioned hardness result, since there we argued that unless
P=NP one cannot have an algorithm whose dependence on the dimension n is
polynomial as well.

8.2.3

Boolean Conjunctions
A Boolean conjunction is a mapping from X = {0, 1}n to Y = {0, 1} that can be
expressed as a proposition formula of the form xi1 ∧ . . .∧ xik ∧¬xj1 ∧ . . .∧¬xjr ,
for some indices i1, . . . , ik, j1, . . . , jr ∈ [n]. The function that such a proposition
formula deﬁnes is

(cid:40)

h(x) =

otherwise

0

Let Hn

C be the class of all Boolean conjunctions over {0, 1}n. The size of Hn

C is
at most 3n + 1 (since in a conjunction formula, each element of x either appears,
or appears with a negation sign, or does not appear at all, and we also have the
all negative formula). Hence, the sample complexity of learning Hn
C using the
ERM rule is at most n log(3/δ)/.

Eﬃciently Learnable in the Realizable Case
Next, we show that it is possible to solve the ERM problem for Hn
C in time
polynomial in n and m. The idea is to deﬁne an ERM conjunction by including
in the hypothesis conjunction all the literals that do not contradict any positively
labeled example. Let v1, . . . , vm+ be all the positively labeled instances in the
input sample S. We deﬁne, by induction on i ≤ m+, a sequence of hypotheses
(or conjunctions). Let h0 be the conjunction of all possible literals. That is,
h0 = x1 ∧ ¬x1 ∧ x2 ∧ . . . ∧ xn ∧ ¬xn. Note that h0 assigns the label 0 to all the
elements of X . We obtain hi+1 by deleting from the conjunction hi all the literals
that are not satisﬁed by vi+1. The algorithm outputs the hypothesis hm+. Note
that hm+ labels positively all the positively labeled examples in S. Furthermore,
for every i ≤ m+, hi is the most restrictive conjunction that labels v1, . . . , vi
positively. Now, since we consider learning in the realizable setup, there exists
a conjunction hypothesis, f ∈ Hn
C, that is consistent with all the examples in
S. Since hm+ is the most restrictive conjunction that labels positively all the
positively labeled members of S, any instance labeled 0 by f is also labeled 0 by
hm+ . It follows that hm+ has zero training error (w.r.t. S), and is therefore a
legal ERM hypothesis. Note that the running time of this algorithm is O(mn).

Not Eﬃciently Learnable in the Agnostic Case
As in the case of axis aligned rectangles, unless P = NP, there is no algorithm
whose running time is polynomial in m and n that guaranteed to ﬁnd an ERM
hypothesis for the class of Boolean conjunctions in the unrealizable case.

8.2.4

Learning 3-Term DNF

We next show that a slight generalization of the class of Boolean conjunctions
leads to intractability of solving the ERM problem even in the realizable case.
Consider the class of 3-term disjunctive normal form formulae (3-term DNF).
The instance space is X = {0, 1}n and each hypothesis is represented by the
Boolean formula of the form h(x) = A1(x)∨ A2(x)∨ A3(x), where each Ai(x) is
a Boolean conjunction (as deﬁned in the previous section). The output of h(x) is
1 if either A1(x) or A2(x) or A3(x) outputs the label 1. If all three conjunctions
output the label 0 then h(x) = 0.

However, from the computational perspective, this learning problem is hard.
It has been shown (see (Pitt & Valiant 1988, Kearns et al. 1994)) that unless
RP = NP, there is no polynomial time algorithm that properly learns a sequence
of 3-term DNF learning problems in which the dimension of the n’th problem is
n. By “properly” we mean that the algorithm should output a hypothesis that is
a 3-term DNF formula. In particular, since ERMHn
outputs a 3-term DNF
formula it is a proper learner and therefore it is hard to implement it. The proof
uses a reduction of the graph 3-coloring problem to the problem of PAC learning
3-term DNF. The detailed technique is given in Exercise 3. See also (Kearns &
Vazirani 1994, Section 1.4).

3DN F

8.3

Eﬃciently Learnable, but Not by a Proper ERM

In the previous section we saw that it is impossible to implement the ERM rule
eﬃciently for the class Hn
3DNF of 3-DNF formulae. In this section we show that it
is possible to learn this class eﬃciently, but using ERM with respect to a larger
class.

Representation Independent Learning Is Not Hard
Next we show that it is possible to learn 3-term DNF formulae eﬃciently. There
is no contradiction to the hardness result mentioned in the previous section as we
now allow “representation independent” learning. That is, we allow the learning
algorithm to output a hypothesis that is not a 3-term DNF formula. The ba-
sic idea is to replace the original hypothesis class of 3-term DNF formula with
a larger hypothesis class so that the new class is easily learnable. The learning

108

The Runtime of Learning

algorithm might return a hypothesis that does not belong to the original hypoth-
esis class; hence the name “representation independent” learning. We emphasize
that in most situations, returning a hypothesis with good predictive ability is
what we are really interested in doing.
We start by noting that because ∨ distributes over ∧, each 3-term DNF formula

can be rewritten as

A1 ∨ A2 ∨ A3 =

(cid:94)

(u ∨ v ∨ w)

u∈A1,v∈A2,w∈A3

Next, let us deﬁne: ψ : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}(2n)3
such that for each triplet of literals
u, v, w there is a variable in the range of ψ indicating if u∨ v ∨ w is true or false.
So, for each 3-DNF formula over {0, 1}n there is a conjunction over {0, 1}(2n)3
,
with the same truth table. Since we assume that the data is realizable, we can
solve the ERM problem with respect to the class of conjunctions over {0, 1}(2n)3
.
Furthermore, the sample complexity of learning the class of conjunctions in the
higher dimensional space is at most n3 log(1/δ)/. Thus, the overall runtime of
this approach is polynomial in n.

Intuitively, the idea is as follows. We started with a hypothesis class for which
learning is hard. We switched to another representation where the hypothesis
class is larger than the original class but has more structure, which allows for a
more eﬃcient ERM search. In the new representation, solving the ERM problem
is easy.

Hardness of Learning*

We have just demonstrated that the computational hardness of implementing
ERMH does not imply that such a class H is not learnable. How can we prove
that a learning problem is computationally hard?

One approach is to rely on cryptographic assumptions. In some sense, cryp-
tography is the opposite of learning. In learning we try to uncover some rule
underlying the examples we see, whereas in cryptography, the goal is to make
sure that nobody will be able to discover some secret, in spite of having access

8.4 Hardness of Learning*

109

to some partial information about it. On that high level intuitive sense, results
about the cryptographic security of some system translate into results about
the unlearnability of some corresponding task. Regrettably, currently one has no
way of proving that a cryptographic protocol is not breakable. Even the common
assumption of P (cid:54)= NP does not suﬃce for that (although it can be shown to
be necessary for most common cryptographic scenarios). The common approach
for proving that cryptographic protocols are secure is to start with some cryp-
tographic assumptions. The more these are used as a basis for cryptography, the
stronger is our belief that they really hold (or, at least, that algorithms that will
refute them are hard to come by).

We now brieﬂy describe the basic idea of how to deduce hardness of learnabil-
ity from cryptographic assumptions. Many cryptographic systems rely on the
assumption that there exists a one way function. Roughly speaking, a one way
function is a function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}n (more formally, it is a sequence of
functions, one for each dimension n) that is easy to compute but is hard to in-
vert. More formally, f can be computed in time poly(n) but for any randomized
polynomial time algorithm A, and for every polynomial p(·),

P[f (A(f (x))) = f (x)] < 1

p(n) ,

where the probability is taken over a random choice of x according to the uniform
distribution over {0, 1}n and the randomness of A.

A one way function, f , is called trapdoor one way function if, for some poly-
nomial function p, for every n there exists a bit-string sn (called a secret key) of
length ≤ p(n), such that there is a polynomial time algorithm that, for every n
and every x ∈ {0, 1}n, on input (f (x), sn) outputs x. In other words, although
f is hard to invert, once one has access to its secret key, inverting f becomes
feasible. Such functions are parameterized by their secret key.
Now, let Fn be a family of trapdoor functions over {0, 1}n that can be calcu-
lated by some polynomial time algorithm. That is, we ﬁx an algorithm that given
a secret key (representing one function in Fn) and an input vector, it calculates
the value of the function corresponding to the secret key on the input vector in
polynomial time. Consider the task of learning the class of the corresponding
F = {f−1 : f ∈ Fn}. Since each function in this class can be inverted
inverses, H n
by some secret key sn of size polynomial in n, the class H n
F can be parameter-
ized by these keys and its size is at most 2p(n). Its sample complexity is therefore
polynomial in n. We claim that there can be no eﬃcient learner for this class. If
there were such a learner, L, then by sampling uniformly at random a polynomial
number of strings in {0, 1}n, and computing f over them, we could generate a
labeled training sample of pairs (f (x), x), which should suﬃce for our learner to
ﬁgure out an (, δ) approximation of f−1 (w.r.t. the uniform distribution over
the range of f ), which would violate the one way property of f .

A more detailed treatment, as well as a concrete example, can be found in
(Kearns & Vazirani 1994, Chapter 6). Using reductions, they also show that

the class of functions that can be calculated by small Boolean circuits is not
eﬃciently learnable, even in the realizable case.

Summary

The runtime of learning algorithms is asymptotically analyzed as a function of
diﬀerent parameters of the learning problem, such as the size of the hypothe-
sis class, our measure of accuracy, our measure of conﬁdence, or the size of the
domain set. We have demonstrated cases in which the ERM rule can be imple-
mented eﬃciently. For example, we derived eﬃcient algorithms for solving the
ERM problem for the class of Boolean conjunctions and the class of axis aligned
rectangles, under the realizability assumption. However, implementing ERM for
these classes in the agnostic case is NP-hard. Recall that from the statistical
perspective, there is no diﬀerence between the realizable and agnostic cases (i.e.,
a class is learnable in both cases if and only if it has a ﬁnite VC-dimension).
In contrast, as we saw, from the computational perspective the diﬀerence is im-
mense. We have also shown another example, the class of 3-term DNF, where
implementing ERM is hard even in the realizable case, yet the class is eﬃciently
learnable by another algorithm.

Hardness of implementing the ERM rule for several natural hypothesis classes
has motivated the development of alternative learning methods, which we will
discuss in the next part of this book.

Bibliographic Remarks

Valiant (1984) introduced the eﬃcient PAC learning model in which the runtime
of the algorithm is required to be polynomial in 1/, 1/δ, and the representation
size of hypotheses in the class. A detailed discussion and thorough bibliographic
notes are given in Kearns & Vazirani (1994).

Exercises
1. Let H be the class of intervals on the line (formally equivalent to axis aligned
rectangles in dimension n = 1). Propose an implementation of the ERMH
learning rule (in the agnostic case) that given a training set of size m, runs
in time O(m2).
Hint: Use dynamic programming.

2. Let H1,H2, . . . be a sequence of hypothesis classes for binary classiﬁcation.
Assume that there is a learning algorithm that implements the ERM rule in
the realizable case such that the output hypothesis of the algorithm for each
class Hn only depends on O(n) examples out of the training set. Furthermore,

8.7 Exercises

111

assume that such a hypothesis can be calculated given these O(n) examples
in time O(n), and that the empirical risk of each such hypothesis can be
evaluated in time O(mn). For example, if Hn is the class of axis aligned
rectangles in Rn, we saw that it is possible to ﬁnd an ERM hypothesis in the
realizable case that is deﬁned by at most 2n examples. Prove that in such
cases, it is possible to ﬁnd an ERM hypothesis for Hn in the unrealizable case
in time O(mn mO(n)).

3. In this exercise, we present several classes for which ﬁnding an ERM classi-
ﬁer is computationally hard. First, we introduce the class of n-dimensional
halfspaces, HSn, for a domain X = Rn. This is the class of all functions of
the form hw,b(x) = sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b) where w, x ∈ Rn, (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) is their inner
product, and b ∈ R. See a detailed description in Chapter 9.
1. Show that ERMH over the class H = HSn of linear predictors is compu-
tationally hard. More precisely, we consider the sequence of problems in
which the dimension n grows linearly and the number of examples m is set
to be some constant times n.
Hint: You can prove the hardness by a reduction from the following prob-
lem:
Max FS: Given a system of linear inequalities, Ax > b with A ∈ Rm×n and b ∈
Rm (that is, a system of m linear inequalities in n variables, x = (x1, . . . , xn)),
ﬁnd a subsystem containing as many inequalities as possible that has a solution
(such a subsystem is called feasible).
It has been shown (Sankaran 1993) that the problem Max FS is NP-hard.
Show that any algorithm that ﬁnds an ERMHSn hypothesis for any training
sample S ∈ (Rn ×{+1,−1})m can be used to solve the Max FS problem of
size m, n. Hint: Deﬁne a mapping that transforms linear inequalities in n
variables into labeled points in Rn, and a mapping that transforms vectors
in Rn to halfspaces, such that a vector w satisﬁes an inequality q if and
only if the labeled point that corresponds to q is classiﬁed correctly by the
halfspace corresponding to w. Conclude that the problem of empirical risk
minimization for halfspaces in also NP-hard (that is, if it can be solved in
time polynomial in the sample size, m, and the Euclidean dimension, n,
then every problem in the class NP can be solved in polynomial time).

2. Let X = Rn and let Hn

k be the class of all intersections of k-many linear
halfspaces in Rn. In this exercise, we wish to show that ERMHn
is com-
putationally hard for every k ≥ 3. Precisely, we consider a sequence of
problems where k ≥ 3 is a constant and n grows linearly. The training set
size, m, also grows linearly with n.
Towards this goal, consider the k-coloring problem for graphs, deﬁned as
follows:
Given a graph G = (V, E), and a number k, determine whether there exists a
function f : V → {1 . . . k} so that for every (u, v) ∈ E, f (u) (cid:54)= f (v).
The k-coloring problem is known to be NP-hard for every k ≥ 3 (Karp
1972).

We wish to reduce the k-coloring problem to ERMHn
: that is, to prove
that if there is an algorithm that solves the ERMHn

algorithm for the graph k-coloring problem.
Given a graph G = (V, E), let {v1 . . . vn} be the vertices in V . Construct
a sample S(G) ∈ (Rn × {±1})m, where m = |V | + |E|, as follows:

coloring of V by setting f (vi) to be the minimal j such that hj(ei) = −1.
Use the fact that halfspaces are convex sets to show that it cannot be
true that two vertices that are connected by an edge have the same
color.

2. Prove that if G is k-colorable then there exists some h ∈ H n

k that has

zero error over S(G).
Hint: Given a coloring f of the vertices of G, we should come up with k
hyperplanes, h1 . . . hk whose intersection is a perfect classiﬁer for S(G).
Let b = 0.6 for all of these hyperplanes and, for t ≤ k let the i’th weight
of the t’th hyperplane, wt,i, be −1 if f (vi) = t and 0 otherwise.

3. Based on the above, prove that for any k ≥ 3, the ERMHn

problem is

k

NP-hard.

4. In this exercise we show that hardness of solving the ERM problem is equiv-
alent to hardness of proper PAC learning. Recall that by “properness” of the
algorithm we mean that it must output a hypothesis from the hypothesis
class. To formalize this statement, we ﬁrst need the following deﬁnition.

definition 8.2 The complexity class Randomized Polynomial (RP) time
is the class of all decision problems (that is, problems in which on any instance
one has to ﬁnd out whether the answer is YES or NO) for which there exists a
probabilistic algorithm (namely, the algorithm is allowed to ﬂip random coins
while it is running) with these properties:
• On any input instance the algorithm runs in polynomial time in the input

size.

• If the correct answer is NO, the algorithm must return NO.
• If the correct answer is YES, the algorithm returns YES with probability

a ≥ 1/2 and returns NO with probability 1 − a.1

Clearly the class RP contains the class P. It is also known that RP is
contained in the class NP. It is not known whether any equality holds among
these three complexity classes, but it is widely believed that NP is strictly

1 The constant 1/2 in the deﬁnition can be replaced by any constant in (0, 1).

8.7 Exercises

113

larger than RP. In particular, it is believed that NP-hard problems cannot be
solved by a randomized polynomial time algorithm.
• Show that if a class H is properly PAC learnable by a polynomial time
algorithm, then the ERMH problem is in the class RP. In particular, this
implies that whenever the ERMH problem is NP-hard (for example, the
class of intersections of halfspaces discussed in the previous exercise),
then, unless NP = RP, there exists no polynomial time proper PAC
learning algorithm for H.
Hint: Assume you have an algorithm A that properly PAC learns a
class H in time polynomial in some class parameter n as well as in 1/
and 1/δ. Your goal is to use that algorithm as a subroutine to contract
an algorithm B for solving the ERMH problem in random polynomial
time. Given a training set, S ∈ (X × {±1}m), and some h ∈ H whose
error on S is zero, apply the PAC learning algorithm to the uniform
distribution over S and run it so that with probability ≥ 0.3 it ﬁnds a
function h ∈ H that has error less than  = 1/|S| (with respect to that
uniform distribution). Show that the algorithm just described satisﬁes
the requirements for being a RP solver for ERMH.

Linear Predictors

In this chapter we will study the family of linear predictors, one of the most
useful families of hypothesis classes. Many learning algorithms that are being
widely used in practice rely on linear predictors, ﬁrst and foremost because of
the ability to learn them eﬃciently in many cases. In addition, linear predictors
are intuitive, are easy to interpret, and ﬁt the data reasonably well in many
natural learning problems.

We will introduce several hypothesis classes belonging to this family – halfspaces,

linear regression predictors, and logistic regression predictors – and present rele-
vant learning algorithms: linear programming and the Perceptron algorithm for
the class of halfspaces and the Least Squares algorithm for linear regression.
This chapter is focused on learning linear predictors using the ERM approach;
however, in later chapters we will see alternative paradigms for learning these
hypothesis classes.

First, we deﬁne the class of aﬃne functions as

where

hw,b(x) = (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b =

wixi

+ b.

Ld = {hw,b : w ∈ Rd, b ∈ R},

(cid:32) d(cid:88)

(cid:33)

It will be convenient also to use the notation

i=1

Ld = {x (cid:55)→ (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b : w ∈ Rd, b ∈ R},

which reads as follows: Ld is a set of functions, where each function is parame-
terized by w ∈ Rd and b ∈ R, and each such function takes as input a vector x
and returns as output the scalar (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b.
The diﬀerent hypothesis classes of linear predictors are compositions of a func-
tion φ : R → Y on Ld. For example, in binary classiﬁcation, we can choose φ to
be the sign function, and for regression problems, where Y = R, φ is simply the
identity function.

It may be more convenient to incorporate b, called the bias, into w as an
extra coordinate and add an extra coordinate with a value of 1 to all x ∈ X ;
namely, let w(cid:48) = (b, w1, w2, . . . wd) ∈ Rd+1 and let x(cid:48) = (1, x1, x2, . . . , xd) ∈

Rd+1. Therefore,

hw,b(x) = (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b = (cid:104)w(cid:48), x(cid:48)(cid:105).

It follows that each aﬃne function in Rd can be rewritten as a homogenous linear
function in Rd+1 applied over the transformation that appends the constant 1
to each input vector. Therefore, whenever it simpliﬁes the presentation, we will
omit the bias term and refer to Ld as the class of homogenous linear functions
of the form hw(x) = (cid:104)w, x(cid:105).

Throughout the book we often use the general term “linear functions” for both

aﬃne functions and (homogenous) linear functions.

9.1

Halfspaces

The ﬁrst hypothesis class we consider is the class of halfspaces, designed for
binary classiﬁcation problems, namely, X = Rd and Y = {−1, +1}. The class of
halfspaces is deﬁned as follows:

HSd = sign ◦ Ld = {x (cid:55)→ sign(hw,b(x)) : hw,b ∈ Ld}.

In other words, each halfspace hypothesis in HSd is parameterized by w ∈
Rd and b ∈ R and upon receiving a vector x the hypothesis returns the label
sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b).

To illustrate this hypothesis class geometrically, it is instructive to consider
the case d = 2. Each hypothesis forms a hyperplane that is perpendicular to the
vector w and intersects the vertical axis at the point (0,−b/w2). The instances
that are “above” the hyperplane, that is, share an acute angle with w, are labeled
positively. Instances that are “below” the hyperplane, that is, share an obtuse
angle with w, are labeled negatively.

In Section 9.1.3 we will show that VCdim(HSd) = d + 1. It follows that we
can learn halfspaces using the ERM paradigm, as long as the sample size is
Ω
. Therefore, we now discuss how to implement an ERM procedure
for halfspaces.



We introduce below two solutions to ﬁnding an ERM halfspace in the realiz-
able case. In the context of halfspaces, the realizable case is often referred to as
the “separable” case, since it is possible to separate with a hyperplane all the
positive examples from all the negative examples. Implementing the ERM rule

9.1 Halfspaces

119

in the nonseparable case (i.e., the agnostic case) is known to be computationally
hard (Ben-David & Simon 2001). There are several approaches to learning non-
separable data. The most popular one is to use surrogate loss functions, namely,
to learn a halfspace that does not necessarily minimize the empirical risk with
the 0 − 1 loss, but rather with respect to a diﬀferent loss function. For example,
in Section 9.3 we will describe the logistic regression approach, which can be
implemented eﬃciently even in the nonseparable case. We will study surrogate
loss functions in more detail later on in Chapter 12.

9.1.1

Linear Programming for the Class of Halfspaces

Linear programs (LP) are problems that can be expressed as maximizing a linear
function subject to linear inequalities. That is,

(cid:104)u, w(cid:105)

max
w∈Rd
subject to

Aw ≥ v

where w ∈ Rd is the vector of variables we wish to determine, A is an m ×
d matrix, and v ∈ Rm, u ∈ Rd are vectors. Linear programs can be solved
eﬃciently,1 and furthermore, there are publicly available implementations of LP
solvers.

We will show that the ERM problem for halfspaces in the realizable case can
be expressed as a linear program. For simplicity, we assume the homogenous
case. Let S = {(xi, yi)}m
i=1 be a training set of size m. Since we assume the
realizable case, an ERM predictor should have zero errors on the training set.
That is, we are looking for some vector w ∈ Rd for which
∀i = 1, . . . , m.

sign((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105)) = yi,

Equivalently, we are looking for some vector w for which
∀i = 1, . . . , m.

yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) > 0,

Let w∗ be a vector that satisﬁes this condition (it must exist since we assume
realizability). Deﬁne γ = mini(yi(cid:104)w∗, xi(cid:105)) and let ¯w = w∗
γ . Therefore, for all i
we have

yi(cid:104) ¯w, xi(cid:105) =

1
γ

yi(cid:104)w∗, xi(cid:105) ≥ 1.

We have thus shown that there exists a vector that satisﬁes

yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) ≥ 1,

∀i = 1, . . . , m.

(9.1)

And clearly, such a vector is an ERM predictor.

To ﬁnd a vector that satisﬁes Equation (9.1) we can rely on an LP solver as
follows. Set A to be the m × d matrix whose rows are the instances multiplied

1 Namely, in time polynomial in m, d, and in the representation size of real numbers.

120

Linear Predictors

by yi. That is, Ai,j = yi xi,j, where xi,j is the j’th element of the vector xi. Let
v be the vector (1, . . . , 1) ∈ Rm. Then, Equation (9.1) can be rewritten as

Aw ≥ v.

The LP form requires a maximization objective, yet all the w that satisfy the
constraints are equal candidates as output hypotheses. Thus, we set a “dummy”
objective, u = (0, . . . , 0) ∈ Rd.

9.1.2

Perceptron for Halfspaces

A diﬀerent implementation of the ERM rule is the Perceptron algorithm of
Rosenblatt (Rosenblatt 1958). The Perceptron is an iterative algorithm that
constructs a sequence of vectors w(1), w(2), . . .. Initially, w(1) is set to be the
all-zeros vector. At iteration t, the Perceptron ﬁnds an example i that is mis-
labeled by w(t), namely, an example for which sign((cid:104)w(t), xi(cid:105)) (cid:54)= yi. Then, the
Perceptron updates w(t) by adding to it the instance xi scaled by the label yi.
That is, w(t+1) = w(t) + yixi. Recall that our goal is to have yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) > 0 for
all i and note that

yi(cid:104)w(t+1), xi(cid:105) = yi(cid:104)w(t) + yixi, xi(cid:105) = yi(cid:104)w(t), xi(cid:105) + (cid:107)xi(cid:107)2.

Hence, the update of the Perceptron guides the solution to be “more correct” on
the i’th example.

Batch Perceptron

input: A training set (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)

if (∃ i s.t. yi(cid:104)w(t), xi(cid:105) ≤ 0) then
w(t+1) = w(t) + yixi

else

output w(t)

The following theorem guarantees that in the realizable case, the algorithm

stops with all sample points correctly classiﬁed.
theorem 9.1 Assume that (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym) is separable, let B = min{(cid:107)w(cid:107) :
yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) ≥ 1}, and let R = maxi (cid:107)xi(cid:107). Then, the Perceptron al-
∀i ∈ [m],
gorithm stops after at most (RB)2 iterations, and when it stops it holds that
∀i ∈ [m], yi(cid:104)w(t), xi(cid:105) > 0.
Proof By the deﬁnition of the stopping condition, if the Perceptron stops it
must have separated all the examples. We will show that if the Perceptron runs
for T iterations, then we must have T ≤ (RB)2, which implies the Perceptron
must stop after at most (RB)2 iterations.

Let w(cid:63) be a vector that achieves the minimum in the deﬁnition of B. That is,

9.1 Halfspaces

121

yi(cid:104)w(cid:63), xi(cid:105) ≥ 1 for all i, and among all vectors that satisfy these constraints, w(cid:63)
is of minimal norm.

The idea of the proof is to show that after performing T iterations, the cosine
√
of the angle between w(cid:63) and w(T +1) is at least
RB . That is, we will show that
√

T

(cid:104)w(cid:63), w(T +1)(cid:105)

T

.

(9.2)

By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, the left-hand side of Equation (9.2) is at
most 1. Therefore, Equation (9.2) would imply that

√

T
RB

1 ≥

⇒ T ≤ (RB)2,

which will conclude our proof.

To show that Equation (9.2) holds, we ﬁrst show that (cid:104)w(cid:63), w(T +1)(cid:105) ≥ T .
Indeed, at the ﬁrst iteration, w(1) = (0, . . . , 0) and therefore (cid:104)w(cid:63), w(1)(cid:105) = 0,
while on iteration t, if we update using example (xi, yi) we have that

(cid:104)w(cid:63), w(t+1)(cid:105) − (cid:104)w(cid:63), w(t)(cid:105) = (cid:104)w(cid:63), w(t+1) − w(t)(cid:105)

= (cid:104)w(cid:63), yixi(cid:105) = yi(cid:104)w(cid:63), xi(cid:105)
≥ 1.

Therefore, after performing T iterations, we get:

T(cid:88)

(cid:16)(cid:104)w(cid:63), w(t+1)(cid:105) − (cid:104)w(cid:63), w(t)(cid:105)(cid:17) ≥ T,

(cid:104)w(cid:63), w(T +1)(cid:105) =

t=1

as required.

Next, we upper bound (cid:107)w(T +1)(cid:107). For each iteration t we have that

(cid:107)w(t+1)(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)w(t) + yixi(cid:107)2

= (cid:107)w(t)(cid:107)2 + 2yi(cid:104)w(t), xi(cid:105) + y2
≤ (cid:107)w(t)(cid:107)2 + R2

i (cid:107)xi(cid:107)2

(9.3)

(9.4)

where the last inequality is due to the fact that example i is necessarily such
that yi(cid:104)w(t), xi(cid:105) ≤ 0, and the norm of xi is at most R. Now, since (cid:107)w(1)(cid:107)2 = 0,
if we use Equation (9.4) recursively for T iterations, we obtain that

(cid:107)w(T +1)(cid:107)2 ≤ TR2 ⇒ (cid:107)w(T +1)(cid:107) ≤

(9.5)
Combining Equation (9.3) with Equation (9.5), and using the fact that (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107) =
B, we obtain that

T R.

(cid:104)w(T +1), w(cid:63)(cid:105)

We have thus shown that Equation (9.2) holds, and this concludes our proof.

Linear Predictors

Remark 9.1 The Perceptron is simple to implement and is guaranteed to con-
verge. However, the convergence rate depends on the parameter B, which in
some situations might be exponentially large in d. In such cases, it would be
better to implement the ERM problem by solving a linear program, as described
in the previous section. Nevertheless, for many natural data sets, the size of B
is not too large, and the Perceptron converges quite fast.

9.1.3

The VC Dimension of Halfspaces

To compute the VC dimension of halfspaces, we start with the homogenous case.
theorem 9.2 The VC dimension of the class of homogenous halfspaces in Rd
is d.

Proof First, consider the set of vectors e1, . . . , ed, where for every i the vector
ei is the all zeros vector except 1 in the i’th coordinate. This set is shattered
by the class of homogenous halfspaces. Indeed, for every labeling y1, . . . , yd, set
w = (y1, . . . , yd), and then (cid:104)w, ei(cid:105) = yi for all i.

real numbers a1, . . . , ad+1, not all of them are zero, such that (cid:80)d+1

Next, let x1, . . . , xd+1 be a set of d + 1 vectors in Rd. Then, there must exist
i=1 aixi = 0.
Let I = {i : ai > 0} and J = {j : aj < 0}. Either I or J is nonempty. Let us
ﬁrst assume that both of them are nonempty. Then,
|aj|xj.

(cid:88)

aixi =

Now, suppose that x1, . . . , xd+1 are shattered by the class of homogenous classes.
Then, there must exist a vector w such that (cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) > 0 for all i ∈ I while
(cid:104)w, xj(cid:105) < 0 for every j ∈ J. It follows that

0 <

which leads to a contradiction. Finally, if J (respectively, I) is empty then the
right-most (respectively, left-most) inequality should be replaced by an equality,
which still leads to a contradiction.

theorem 9.3 The VC dimension of the class of nonhomogenous halfspaces in
Rd is d + 1.

Proof First, as in the proof of Theorem 9.2, it is easy to verify that the set
of vectors 0, e1, . . . , ed is shattered by the class of nonhomogenous halfspaces.
Second, suppose that the vectors x1, . . . , xd+2 are shattered by the class of non-
homogenous halfspaces. But, using the reduction we have shown in the beginning
of this chapter, it follows that there are d + 2 vectors in Rd+1 that are shattered
by the class of homogenous halfspaces. But this contradicts Theorem 9.2.

Linear Regression

Linear regression is a common statistical tool for modeling the relationship be-
tween some “explanatory” variables and some real valued outcome. Cast as a
learning problem, the domain set X is a subset of Rd, for some d, and the la-
bel set Y is the set of real numbers. We would like to learn a linear function
h : Rd → R that best approximates the relationship between our variables (say,
for example, predicting the weight of a baby as a function of her age and weight
at birth). Figure 9.1 shows an example of a linear regression predictor for d = 1.
The hypothesis class of linear regression predictors is simply the set of linear

functions,

Hreg = Ld = {x (cid:55)→ (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b : w ∈ Rd, b ∈ R}.

Next we need to deﬁne a loss function for regression. While in classiﬁcation the
deﬁnition of the loss is straightforward, as (cid:96)(h, (x, y)) simply indicates whether
h(x) correctly predicts y or not, in regression, if the baby’s weight is 3 kg, both
the predictions 3.00001 kg and 4 kg are “wrong,” but we would clearly prefer
the former over the latter. We therefore need to deﬁne how much we shall be
“penalized” for the discrepancy between h(x) and y. One common way is to use
the squared-loss function, namely,

(cid:96)(h, (x, y)) = (h(x) − y)2.

For this loss function, the empirical risk function is called the Mean Squared
Error, namely,

m(cid:88)

i=1

LS(h) =

1
m

(h(xi) − yi)2.

124

Linear Predictors

In the next subsection, we will see how to implement the ERM rule for linear
regression with respect to the squared loss. Of course, there are a variety of other
loss functions that one can use, for example, the absolute value loss function,
(cid:96)(h, (x, y)) = |h(x) − y|. The ERM rule for the absolute value loss function can
be implemented using linear programming (see Exercise 1.)

Note that since linear regression is not a binary prediction task, we cannot an-
alyze its sample complexity using the VC-dimension. One possible analysis of the
sample complexity of linear regression is by relying on the “discretization trick”
(see Remark 4.1 in Chapter 4); namely, if we are happy with a representation of
each element of the vector w and the bias b using a ﬁnite number of bits (say
a 64 bits ﬂoating point representation), then the hypothesis class becomes ﬁnite
and its size is at most 264(d+1). We can now rely on sample complexity bounds
for ﬁnite hypothesis classes as described in Chapter 4. Note, however, that to
apply the sample complexity bounds from Chapter 4 we also need that the loss
function will be bounded. Later in the book we will describe more rigorous means
to analyze the sample complexity of regression problems.

9.2.1

Least Squares

Least squares is the algorithm that solves the ERM problem for the hypoth-
esis class of linear regression predictors with respect to the squared loss. The
ERM problem with respect to this class, given a training set S, and using the
homogenous version of Ld, is to ﬁnd

If A is invertible then the solution to the ERM problem is

w = A−1 b.

The case in which A is not invertible requires a few standard tools from linear
algebra, which are available in Appendix C. It can be easily shown that if the
training instances do not span the entire space of Rd then A is not invertible.
Nevertheless, we can always ﬁnd a solution to the system Aw = b because b
is in the range of A. Indeed, since A is symmetric we can write it using its
eigenvalue decomposition as A = V DV (cid:62), where D is a diagonal matrix and V
is an orthonormal matrix (that is, V (cid:62)V is the identity d × d matrix). Deﬁne
D+ to be the diagonal matrix such that D+
i,i = 0 if Di,i = 0 and otherwise
D+

i,i = 1/Di,i. Now, deﬁne

A+ = V D+V (cid:62)

and

ˆw = A+b.

Let vi denote the i’th column of V . Then, we have

A ˆw = AA+b = V DV (cid:62)V D+V (cid:62)b = V DD+V (cid:62)b =

(cid:88)

i:Di,i(cid:54)=0

viv(cid:62)

i b.

That is, A ˆw is the projection of b onto the span of those vectors vi for which
Di,i (cid:54)= 0. Since the linear span of x1, . . . , xm is the same as the linear span of
those vi, and b is in the linear span of the xi, we obtain that A ˆw = b, which
concludes our argument.

9.2.2

Linear Regression for Polynomial Regression Tasks

Some learning tasks call for nonlinear predictors, such as polynomial predictors.
Take, for instance, a one dimensional polynomial function of degree n, that is,

p(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + ··· + anxn

where (a0, . . . , an) is a vector of coeﬃcients of size n + 1. In the following we
depict a training set that is better ﬁtted using a 3rd degree polynomial predictor
than using a linear predictor.

126

Linear Predictors

We will focus here on the class of one dimensional, n-degree, polynomial re-

gression predictors, namely,

Hn
poly = {x (cid:55)→ p(x)},

where p is a one dimensional polynomial of degree n, parameterized by a vector
of coeﬃcients (a0, . . . , an). Note that X = R, since this is a one dimensional
polynomial, and Y = R, as this is a regression problem.

One way to learn this class is by reduction to the problem of linear regression,
which we have already shown how to solve. To translate a polynomial regression
problem to a linear regression problem, we deﬁne the mapping ψ : R → Rn+1
such that ψ(x) = (1, x, x2, . . . , xn). Then we have that

p(ψ(x)) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + ··· + anxn = (cid:104)a, ψ(x)(cid:105)

and we can ﬁnd the optimal vector of coeﬃcients a by using the Least Squares
algorithm as shown earlier.

9.3

Logistic Regression

In logistic regression we learn a family of functions h from Rd to the interval [0, 1].
However, logistic regression is used for classiﬁcation tasks: We can interpret h(x)
as the probability that the label of x is 1. The hypothesis class associated with
logistic regression is the composition of a sigmoid function φsig : R → [0, 1] over
the class of linear functions Ld. In particular, the sigmoid function used in logistic
regression is the logistic function, deﬁned as

φsig(z) =

1

1 + exp(−z)

.

(9.9)

The name “sigmoid” means “S-shaped,” referring to the plot of this function,
shown in the ﬁgure:

9.3 Logistic Regression

127

The hypothesis class is therefore (where for simplicity we are using homogenous

linear functions):

Hsig = φsig ◦ Ld = {x (cid:55)→ φsig((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) : w ∈ Rd}.

Note that when (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) is very large then φsig((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) is close to 1, whereas if
(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) is very small then φsig((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) is close to 0. Recall that the prediction of the
halfspace corresponding to a vector w is sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)). Therefore, the predictions
of the halfspace hypothesis and the logistic hypothesis are very similar whenever
|(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)| is large. However, when |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)| is close to 0 we have that φsig((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) ≈
1
2 . Intuitively, the logistic hypothesis is not sure about the value of the label so it
guesses that the label is sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) with probability slightly larger than 50%.
In contrast, the halfspace hypothesis always outputs a deterministic prediction
of either 1 or −1, even if |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)| is very close to 0.

Next, we need to specify a loss function. That is, we should deﬁne how bad it
is to predict some hw(x) ∈ [0, 1] given that the true label is y ∈ {±1}. Clearly,
we would like that hw(x) would be large if y = 1 and that 1 − hw(x) (i.e., the
probability of predicting −1) would be large if y = −1. Note that

1 − hw(x) = 1 −

1

1 + exp(−(cid:104)w, x(cid:105))

exp(−(cid:104)w, x(cid:105))
1 + exp(−(cid:104)w, x(cid:105))

=

=

1

1 + exp((cid:104)w, x(cid:105))

.

Therefore, any reasonable loss function would increase monotonically with
or equivalently, would increase monotonically with 1 + exp(−y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)). The lo-
gistic loss function used in logistic regression penalizes hw based on the log of
1 + exp(−y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) (recall that log is a monotonic function). That is,

1

1+exp(y(cid:104)w,x(cid:105)) ,

(cid:96)(hw, (x, y)) = log (1 + exp(−y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105))) .

Therefore, given a training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym), the ERM problem
associated with logistic regression is

m(cid:88)

i=1

log (1 + exp(−yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105))) .

(9.10)

The advantage of the logistic loss function is that it is a convex function with
respect to w; hence the ERM problem can be solved eﬃciently using standard
methods. We will study how to learn with convex functions, and in particular
specify a simple algorithm for minimizing convex functions, in later chapters.

The ERM problem associated with logistic regression (Equation (9.10)) is iden-
tical to the problem of ﬁnding a Maximum Likelihood Estimator, a well-known
statistical approach for ﬁnding the parameters that maximize the joint probabil-
ity of a given data set assuming a speciﬁc parametric probability function. We
will study the Maximum Likelihood approach in Chapter 24.

Linear Predictors

9.4

Summary

The family of linear predictors is one of the most useful families of hypothesis
classes, and many learning algorithms that are being widely used in practice
rely on linear predictors. We have shown eﬃcient algorithms for learning linear
predictors with respect to the zero-one loss in the separable case and with respect
to the squared and logistic losses in the unrealizable case. In later chapters we
will present the properties of the loss function that enable eﬃcient learning.

Naturally, linear predictors are eﬀective whenever we assume, as prior knowl-
edge, that some linear predictor attains low risk with respect to the underlying
distribution. In the next chapter we show how to construct nonlinear predictors
by composing linear predictors on top of simple classes. This will enable us to
employ linear predictors for a variety of prior knowledge assumptions.

Bibliographic Remarks

The Perceptron algorithm dates back to Rosenblatt (1958). The proof of its
convergence rate is due to (Agmon 1954, Novikoﬀ 1962). Least Squares regression
goes back to Gauss (1795), Legendre (1805), and Adrain (1808).

2. Show that the matrix A deﬁned in Equation (9.6) is invertible if and only if

3. Show that Theorem 9.1 is tight in the following sense: For any positive integer

examples {(x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)} such that the following hold:
• R = maxi (cid:107)xi(cid:107) ≤ 1.
• (cid:107)w∗(cid:107)2 = m, and for all i ≤ m, yi(cid:104)xi, w∗(cid:105) ≥ 1. Note that, using the notation

in Theorem 9.1, we therefore get

B = min{(cid:107)w(cid:107) : ∀i ∈ [m], yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) ≥ 1} ≤ √

Theorem 9.1 equals m and the perceptron algorithm is bound to make m
mistakes.
Hint: Set each xi to be a third dimensional vector of the form (a, b, yi), where
a2 + b2 = R2 − 1. Let w∗ be the vector (0, 0, 1). Now, go over the proof of
the Perceptron’s upper bound (Theorem 9.1), see where we used inequalities
(≤) rather than equalities (=), and ﬁgure out scenarios where the inequality
actually holds with equality.

5. Suppose we modify the Perceptron algorithm as follows: In the update step,
instead of performing w(t+1) = w(t) + yixi whenever we make a mistake, we
perform w(t+1) = w(t) + ηyixi for some η > 0. Prove that the modiﬁed Per-
ceptron will perform the same number of iterations as the vanilla Perceptron
and will converge to a vector that points to the same direction as the output
of the vanilla Perceptron.

6. In this problem, we will get bounds on the VC-dimension of the class of

10 Boosting

Boosting is an algorithmic paradigm that grew out of a theoretical question and
became a very practical machine learning tool. The boosting approach uses a
generalization of linear predictors to address two major issues that have been
raised earlier in the book. The ﬁrst is the bias-complexity tradeoﬀ. We have
seen (in Chapter 5) that the error of an ERM learner can be decomposed into
a sum of approximation error and estimation error. The more expressive the
hypothesis class the learner is searching over, the smaller the approximation
error is, but the larger the estimation error becomes. A learner is thus faced with
the problem of picking a good tradeoﬀ between these two considerations. The
boosting paradigm allows the learner to have smooth control over this tradeoﬀ.
The learning starts with a basic class (that might have a large approximation
error), and as it progresses the class that the predictor may belong to grows
richer.

The second issue that boosting addresses is the computational complexity of
learning. As seen in Chapter 8, for many interesting concept classes the task
of ﬁnding an ERM hypothesis may be computationally infeasible. A boosting
algorithm ampliﬁes the accuracy of weak learners. Intuitively, one can think of
a weak learner as an algorithm that uses a simple “rule of thumb” to output a
hypothesis that comes from an easy-to-learn hypothesis class and performs just
slightly better than a random guess. When a weak learner can be implemented
eﬃciently, boosting provides a tool for aggregating such weak hypotheses to
approximate gradually good predictors for larger, and harder to learn, classes.

In this chapter we will describe and analyze a practically useful boosting algo-
rithm, AdaBoost (a shorthand for Adaptive Boosting). The AdaBoost algorithm
outputs a hypothesis that is a linear combination of simple hypotheses. In other
words, AdaBoost relies on the family of hypothesis classes obtained by composing
a linear predictor on top of simple classes. We will show that AdaBoost enables
us to control the tradeoﬀ between the approximation and estimation errors by
varying a single parameter.

AdaBoost demonstrates a general theme, that will recur later in the book, of
expanding the expressiveness of linear predictors by composing them on top of
other functions. This will be elaborated in Section 10.3.

AdaBoost stemmed from the theoretical question of whether an eﬃcient weak
learner can be “boosted” into an eﬃcient strong learner. This question was raised

by Kearns and Valiant in 1988 and solved in 1990 by Robert Schapire, then
a graduate student at MIT. However, the proposed mechanism was not very
practical. In 1995, Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund proposed the AdaBoost
algorithm, which was the ﬁrst truly practical implementation of boosting. This
simple and elegant algorithm became hugely popular, and Freund and Schapire’s
work has been recognized by numerous awards.

Furthermore, boosting is a great example for the practical impact of learning
theory. While boosting originated as a purely theoretical problem, it has led to
popular and widely used algorithms. Indeed, as we shall demonstrate later in
this chapter, AdaBoost has been successfully used for learning to detect faces in
images.

10.1 Weak Learnability

Recall the deﬁnition of PAC learning given in Chapter 3: A hypothesis class,
H, is PAC learnable if there exist mH : (0, 1)2 → N and a learning algorithm
with the following property: For every , δ ∈ (0, 1), for every distribution D over
X , and for every labeling function f : X → {±1}, if the realizable assumption
holds with respect to H,D, f , then when running the learning algorithm on
m ≥ mH(, δ) i.i.d. examples generated by D and labeled by f , the algorithm
returns a hypothesis h such that, with probability of at least 1−δ, L(D,f )(h) ≤ .
Furthermore, the fundamental theorem of learning theory (Theorem 6.8 in
Chapter 6) characterizes the family of learnable classes and states that every PAC
learnable class can be learned using any ERM algorithm. However, the deﬁnition
of PAC learning and the fundamental theorem of learning theory ignores the
computational aspect of learning. Indeed, as we have shown in Chapter 8, there
are cases in which implementing the ERM rule is computationally hard (even in
the realizable case).
However, perhaps we can trade computational hardness with the requirement
for accuracy. Given a distribution D and a target labeling function f , maybe there
exists an eﬃciently computable learning algorithm whose error is just slightly
better than a random guess? This motivates the following deﬁnition.

definition 10.1 (γ-Weak-Learnability)
• A learning algorithm, A, is a γ-weak-learner for a class H if there exists a func-
tion mH : (0, 1) → N such that for every δ ∈ (0, 1), for every distribution
D over X , and for every labeling function f : X → {±1}, if the realizable
assumption holds with respect to H,D, f , then when running the learning
algorithm on m ≥ mH(δ) i.i.d. examples generated by D and labeled by f ,
the algorithm returns a hypothesis h such that, with probability of at least
1 − δ, L(D,f )(h) ≤ 1/2 − γ.
• A hypothesis class H is γ-weak-learnable if there exists a γ-weak-learner for

that class.

132

Boosting

This deﬁnition is almost identical to the deﬁnition of PAC learning, which
here we will call strong learning, with one crucial diﬀerence: Strong learnability
implies the ability to ﬁnd an arbitrarily good classiﬁer (with error rate at most
 for an arbitrarily small  > 0). In weak learnability, however, we only need to
output a hypothesis whose error rate is at most 1/2 − γ, namely, whose error
rate is slightly better than what a random labeling would give us. The hope is
that it may be easier to come up with eﬃcient weak learners than with eﬃcient
(full) PAC learners.



d+log(1/δ)

The fundamental theorem of learning (Theorem 6.8) states that if a hypothesis
class H has a VC dimension d, then the sample complexity of PAC learning H
satisﬁes mH(, δ) ≥ C1
, where C1 is a constant. Applying this with
 = 1/2−γ we immediately obtain that if d = ∞ then H is not γ-weak-learnable.
This implies that from the statistical perspective (i.e., if we ignore computational
complexity), weak learnability is also characterized by the VC dimension of H
and therefore is just as hard as PAC (strong) learning. However, when we do
consider computational complexity, the potential advantage of weak learning is
that maybe there is an algorithm that satisﬁes the requirements of weak learning
and can be implemented eﬃciently.

One possible approach is to take a “simple” hypothesis class, denoted B, and
to apply ERM with respect to B as the weak learning algorithm. For this to
work, we need that B will satisfy two requirements:
• ERMB is eﬃciently implementable.
• For every sample that is labeled by some hypothesis from H, any ERMB

hypothesis will have an error of at most 1/2 − γ.

Then, the immediate question is whether we can boost an eﬃcient weak learner
into an eﬃcient strong learner. In the next section we will show that this is
indeed possible, but before that, let us show an example in which eﬃcient weak
learnability of a class H is possible using a base hypothesis class B.
Example 10.1 (Weak Learning of 3-Piece Classiﬁers Using Decision Stumps)
Let X = R and let H be the class of 3-piece classiﬁers, namely, H = {hθ1,θ2,b :
θ1, θ2 ∈ R, θ1 < θ2, b ∈ {±1}}, where for every x,

(cid:40)

hθ1,θ2,b(x) =

+b
−b

if x < θ1 or x > θ2
if θ1 ≤ x ≤ θ2

An example hypothesis (for b = 1) is illustrated as follows:

+

θ1

−

+

θ2

Let B be the class of Decision Stumps, that is, B = {x (cid:55)→ sign(x− θ)· b : θ ∈
R, b ∈ {±1}}. In the following we show that ERMB is a γ-weak learner for H,
for γ = 1/12.

10.1 Weak Learnability

133

To see that, we ﬁrst show that for every distribution that is consistent with
H, there exists a decision stump with LD(h) ≤ 1/3. Indeed, just note that
every classiﬁer in H consists of three regions (two unbounded rays and a center
interval) with alternate labels. For any pair of such regions, there exists a decision
stump that agrees with the labeling of these two components. Note that for every
distribution D over R and every partitioning of the line into three such regions,
one of these regions must have D-weight of at most 1/3. Let h ∈ H be a zero
error hypothesis. A decision stump that disagrees with h only on such a region
has an error of at most 1/3.
Finally, since the VC-dimension of decision stumps is 2, if the sample size is
greater than Ω(log(1/δ)/2), then with probability of at least 1 − δ, the ERMB
rule returns a hypothesis with an error of at most 1/3 + . Setting  = 1/12 we
obtain that the error of ERMB is at most 1/3 + 1/12 = 1/2 − 1/12.
We see that ERMB is a γ-weak learner for H. We next show how to implement

the ERM rule eﬃciently for decision stumps.

10.1.1

Eﬃcient Implementation of ERM for Decision Stumps
Let X = Rd and consider the base hypothesis class of decision stumps over Rd,
namely,

HDS = {x (cid:55)→ sign(θ − xi) · b : θ ∈ R, i ∈ [d], b ∈ {±1}}.

For simplicity, assume that b = 1; that is, we focus on all the hypotheses in
HDS of the form sign(θ − xi). Let S = ((x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)) be a training set.
We will show how to implement an ERM rule, namely, how to ﬁnd a decision
stump that minimizes LS(h). Furthermore, since in the next section we will
show that AdaBoost requires ﬁnding a hypothesis with a small risk relative to
some distribution over S, we will show here how to minimize such risk functions.
Concretely, let D be a probability vector in Rm (that is, all elements of D are
i Di = 1). The weak learner we describe later receives D and
S and outputs a decision stump h : X → Y that minimizes the risk w.r.t. D,

LD(h) =

Di1[h(xi)(cid:54)=yi].

Note that if D = (1/m, . . . , 1/m) then LD(h) = LS(h).

Recall that each decision stump is parameterized by an index j ∈ [d] and a

threshold θ. Therefore, minimizing LD(h) amounts to solving the problem

Θj = { xi,j +xi+1,j
there exists θ(cid:48) ∈ Θj that yields the same predictions for the sample S as the

134

Boosting

threshold θ. Therefore, instead of minimizing over θ ∈ R we can minimize over
θ ∈ Θj.
This already gives us an eﬃcient procedure: Choose j ∈ [d] and θ ∈ Θj that
minimize the objective value of Equation (10.1). For every j and θ ∈ Θj we
have to calculate a sum over m examples; therefore the runtime of this approach
would be O(dm2). We next show a simple trick that enables us to minimize the
objective in time O(dm).
The observation is as follows. Suppose we have calculated the objective for
θ ∈ (xi−1,j, xi,j). Let F (θ) be the value of the objective. Then, when we consider
θ(cid:48) ∈ (xi,j, xi+1,j) we have that

F (θ(cid:48)) = F (θ) − Di1[yi=1] + Di1[yi=−1] = F (θ) − yiDi.

Therefore, we can calculate the objective at θ(cid:48) in a constant time, given the
objective at the previous threshold, θ. It follows that after a preprocessing step

AdaBoost

AdaBoost (short for Adaptive Boosting) is an algorithm that has access to a
weak learner and ﬁnds a hypothesis with a low empirical risk. The AdaBoost
algorithm receives as input a training set of examples S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym),
where for each i, yi = f (xi) for some labeling function f . The boosting process
proceeds in a sequence of consecutive rounds. At round t, the booster ﬁrst deﬁnes

a distribution over the examples in S, denoted D(t). That is, D(t) ∈ Rm

+ and
i = 1. Then, the booster passes the distribution D(t) and the sample S
to the weak learner. (That way, the weak learner can construct i.i.d. examples
according to D(t) and f .) The weak learner is assumed to return a “weak”
hypothesis, ht, whose error,

fails). Then, AdaBoost assigns a weight for ht as follows: wt = 1
.
That is, the weight of ht is inversely proportional to the error of ht. At the end
of the round, AdaBoost updates the distribution so that examples on which ht
errs will get a higher probability mass while examples on which ht is correct will
get a lower probability mass. Intuitively, this will force the weak learner to focus
on the problematic examples in the next round. The output of the AdaBoost
algorithm is a “strong” classiﬁer that is based on a weighted sum of all the weak
hypotheses. The pseudocode of AdaBoost is presented in the following.

Finally, using the inequality 1 − a ≤ e−a we have that (cid:112)1 − 4γ2 ≤ e−4γ2/2 =

. This shows that Equation (10.3) holds and thus concludes our proof.

e−2γ2

Each iteration of AdaBoost involves O(m) operations as well as a single call to
the weak learner. Therefore, if the weak learner can be implemented eﬃciently
(as happens in the case of ERM with respect to decision stumps) then the total
training process will be eﬃcient.

Remark 10.2 Theorem 10.2 assumes that at each iteration of AdaBoost, the
weak learner returns a hypothesis with weighted sample error of at most 1/2− γ.
According to the deﬁnition of a weak learner, it can fail with probability δ. Using
the union bound, the probability that the weak learner will not fail at all of the
iterations is at least 1 − δT . As we show in Exercise 1, the dependence of the
sample complexity on δ can always be logarithmic in 1/δ, and therefore invoking
the weak learner with a very small δ is not problematic. We can therefore assume
that δT is also small. Furthermore, since the weak learner is only applied with
distributions over the training set, in many cases we can implement the weak
learner so that it will have a zero probability of failure (i.e., δ = 0). This is the
case, for example, in the weak learner that ﬁnds the minimum value of LD(h)
for decision stumps, as described in the previous section.

Theorem 10.2 tells us that the empirical risk of the hypothesis constructed by
AdaBoost goes to zero as T grows. However, what we really care about is the
true risk of the output hypothesis. To argue about the true risk, we note that the
output of AdaBoost is in fact a composition of a halfspace over the predictions
of the T weak hypotheses constructed by the weak learner. In the next section
we show that if the weak hypotheses come from a base hypothesis class of low
VC-dimension, then the estimation error of AdaBoost will be small; namely, the
true risk of the output of AdaBoost would not be very far from its empirical risk.

10.3

Linear Combinations of Base Hypotheses

As mentioned previously, a popular approach for constructing a weak learner
is to apply the ERM rule with respect to a base hypothesis class (e.g., ERM
over decision stumps). We have also seen that boosting outputs a composition
of a halfspace over the predictions of the weak hypotheses. Therefore, given a
base hypothesis class B (e.g., decision stumps), the output of AdaBoost will be
a member of the following class:

L(B, T ) =

x (cid:55)→ sign

wtht(x)

: w ∈ RT , ∀t,

ht ∈ B

.

(10.4)

t=1

That is, each h ∈ L(B, T ) is parameterized by T base hypotheses from B and
by a vector w ∈ RT . The prediction of such an h on an instance x is ob-
tained by ﬁrst applying the T base hypotheses to construct the vector ψ(x) =

138

Boosting

(h1(x), . . . , hT (x)) ∈ RT , and then applying the (homogenous) halfspace deﬁned
by w on ψ(x).

In this section we analyze the estimation error of L(B, T ) by bounding the
VC-dimension of L(B, T ) in terms of the VC-dimension of B and T . We will
show that, up to logarithmic factors, the VC-dimension of L(B, T ) is bounded
by T times the VC-dimension of B. It follows that the estimation error of Ad-
aBoost grows linearly with T . On the other hand, the empirical risk of AdaBoost
decreases with T . In fact, as we demonstrate later, T can be used to decrease
the approximation error of L(B, T ). Therefore, the parameter T of AdaBoost
enables us to control the bias-complexity tradeoﬀ.
the simple example, in which X = R and the base class is Decision Stumps,

To demonstrate how the expressive power of L(B, T ) increases with T , consider

HDS1 = {x (cid:55)→ sign(x − θ) · b :

θ ∈ R, b ∈ {±1}}.

Note that in this one dimensional case, HDS1 is in fact equivalent to (nonho-
mogenous) halfspaces on R.
Now, let H be the rather complex class (compared to halfspaces on the line)
of piece-wise constant functions. Let gr be a piece-wise constant function with at
most r pieces; that is, there exist thresholds −∞ = θ0 < θ1 < θ2 < ··· < θr = ∞
such that

r(cid:88)

gr(x) =

αi1[x∈(θi−1,θi]] ∀i, αi ∈ {±1}.

i=1

Denote by Gr the class of all such piece-wise constant classiﬁers with at most r
pieces.
In the following we show that GT ⊆ L(HDS1, T ); namely, the class of halfspaces
over T decision stumps yields all the piece-wise constant classiﬁers with at most
T pieces.
Indeed, without loss of generality consider any g ∈ GT with αt = (−1)t. This
implies that if x is in the interval (θt−1, θt], then g(x) = (−1)t. For example:

Now, the function

(cid:32) T(cid:88)

h(x) = sign

(cid:33)

wt sign(x − θt−1)

,

where w1 = 0.5 and for t > 1, wt = (−1)t, is in L(HDS1, T ) and is equal to g
(see Exercise 2).

10.3 Linear Combinations of Base Hypotheses

139

From this example we obtain that L(HDS1, T ) can shatter any set of T + 1
instances in R; hence the VC-dimension of L(HDS1, T ) is at least T +1. Therefore,
T is a parameter that can control the bias-complexity tradeoﬀ: Enlarging T
yields a more expressive hypothesis class but on the other hand might increase
the estimation error. In the next subsection we formally upper bound the VC-
dimension of L(B, T ) for any base class B.

10.3.1

The VC-Dimension of L(B, T )

The following lemma tells us that the VC-dimension of L(B, T ) is upper bounded
by ˜O(VCdim(B) T ) (the ˜O notation ignores constants and logarithmic factors).

lemma 10.3 Let B be a base class and let L(B, T ) be as deﬁned in Equa-
tion (10.4). Assume that both T and VCdim(B) are at least 3. Then,

VCdim(L(B, T )) ≤ T (VCdim(B) + 1) (3 log(T (VCdim(B) + 1)) + 2).

Proof Denote d = VCdim(B). Let C = {x1, . . . , xm} be a set that is shat-
tered by L(B, T ). Each labeling of C by h ∈ L(B, T ) is obtained by ﬁrst choos-
ing h1, . . . , hT ∈ B and then applying a halfspace hypothesis over the vector
(h1(x), . . . , hT (x)). By Sauer’s lemma, there are at most (em/d)d diﬀerent di-
chotomies (i.e., labelings) induced by B over C. Therefore, we need to choose
T hypotheses, out of at most (em/d)d diﬀerent hypotheses. There are at most
(em/d)dT ways to do it. Next, for each such choice, we apply a linear predictor,
which yields at most (em/T )T dichotomies. Therefore, the overall number of
dichotomies we can construct is upper bounded by

(em/d)dT (em/T )T ≤ m(d+1)T ,

where we used the assumption that both d and T are at least 3. Since we assume
that C is shattered, we must have that the preceding is at least 2m, which yields

Therefore,

2m ≤ m(d+1)T .

m ≤ log(m)

Lemma A.1 in Chapter A tells us that a necessary condition for the above to
hold is that

(d + 1)T
log(2)

≤ (d + 1)T (3 log((d + 1)T ) + 2),

which concludes our proof.

In Exercise 4 we show that for some base classes, B, it also holds that VCdim(L(B, T )) ≥

Ω(VCdim(B) T ).

pixels within two rectangular regions. These regions have the same size and shape and
are horizontally or vertically adjacent. For type C, the value of g is the sum within
two outside rectangles subtracted from the sum in a center rectangle. For type D, we
compute the diﬀerence between diagonal pairs of rectangles.

10.4

AdaBoost for Face Recognition

We now turn to a base hypothesis that has been proposed by Viola and Jones for
the task of face recognition. In this task, the instance space is images, represented
as matrices of gray level values of pixels. To be concrete, let us take images of
size 24 × 24 pixels, and therefore our instance space is the set of real valued
matrices of size 24 × 24. The goal is to learn a classiﬁer, h : X → {±1}, that
given an image as input, should output whether the image is of a human face or
not.
Each hypothesis in the base class is of the form h(x) = f (g(x)), where f is a
decision stump hypothesis and g : R24,24 → R is a function that maps an image
to a scalar. Each function g is parameterized by
• An axis aligned rectangle R. Since each image is of size 24 × 24, there are at

most 244 axis aligned rectangles.

• A type, t ∈ {A, B, C, D}. Each type corresponds to a mask, as depicted in

Figure 10.1.

To calculate g we stretch the mask t to ﬁt the rectangle R and then calculate
the sum of the pixels (that is, sum of their gray level values) that lie within the
red rectangles and subtract it from the sum of pixels in the blue rectangles.
Since the number of such functions g is at most 244 · 4, we can implement a
weak learner for the base hypothesis class by ﬁrst calculating all the possible
outputs of g on each image, and then apply the weak learner of decision stumps
described in the previous subsection. It is possible to perform the ﬁrst step very

each image in the training set. See Exercise 5 for details.

running it with the base features proposed by Viola and Jones.

Summary

Boosting is a method for amplifying the accuracy of weak learners. In this chapter
we described the AdaBoost algorithm. We have shown that after T iterations of
AdaBoost, it returns a hypothesis from the class L(B, T ), obtained by composing
a linear classiﬁer on T hypotheses from a base class B. We have demonstrated
how the parameter T controls the tradeoﬀ between approximation and estimation
errors. In the next chapter we will study how to tune parameters such as T , based
on the data.

10.6

Bibliographic Remarks

As mentioned before, boosting stemmed from the theoretical question of whether
an eﬃcient weak learner can be “boosted” into an eﬃcient strong learner (Kearns
& Valiant 1988) and solved by Schapire (1990). The AdaBoost algorithm has
been proposed in Freund & Schapire (1995).

Boosting can be viewed from many perspectives. In the purely theoretical
context, AdaBoost can be interpreted as a negative result: If strong learning of
a hypothesis class is computationally hard, so is weak learning of this class. This
negative result can be useful for showing hardness of agnostic PAC learning of
a class B based on hardness of PAC learning of some other class H, as long as

Boosting

H is weakly learnable using B. For example, Klivans & Sherstov (2006) have
shown that PAC learning of the class of intersection of halfspaces is hard (even
in the realizable case). This hardness result can be used to show that agnostic
PAC learning of a single halfspace is also computationally hard (Shalev-Shwartz,
Shamir & Sridharan 2010). The idea is to show that an agnostic PAC learner
for a single halfspace can yield a weak learner for the class of intersection of
halfspaces, and since such a weak learner can be boosted, we will obtain a strong
learner for the class of intersection of halfspaces.

AdaBoost also shows an equivalence between the existence of a weak learner
and separability of the data using a linear classiﬁer over the predictions of base
hypotheses. This result is closely related to von Neumann’s minimax theorem
(von Neumann 1928), a fundamental result in game theory.

AdaBoost is also related to the concept of margin, which we will study later on
in Chapter 15. It can also be viewed as a forward greedy selection algorithm, a
topic that will be presented in Chapter 25. A recent book by Schapire & Freund
(2012) covers boosting from all points of view, and gives easy access to the wealth
of research that this ﬁeld has produced.

11 Model Selection and Validation

In the previous chapter we have described the AdaBoost algorithm and have
shown how the parameter T of AdaBoost controls the bias-complexity trade-
oﬀ. But, how do we set T in practice? More generally, when approaching some
practical problem, we usually can think of several algorithms that may yield a
good solution, each of which might have several parameters. How can we choose
the best algorithm for the particular problem at hand? And how do we set the
algorithm’s parameters? This task is often called model selection.

To illustrate the model selection task, consider the problem of learning a one
dimensional regression function, h : R → R. Suppose that we obtain a training
set as depicted in the ﬁgure.

We can consider ﬁtting a polynomial to the data, as described in Chapter 9.
However, we might be uncertain regarding which degree d would give the best
results for our data set: A small degree may not ﬁt the data well (i.e., it will
have a large approximation error), whereas a high degree may lead to overﬁtting
(i.e., it will have a large estimation error). In the following we depict the result
of ﬁtting a polynomial of degrees 2, 3, and 10. It is easy to see that the empirical
risk decreases as we enlarge the degree. However, looking at the graphs, our
intuition tells us that setting the degree to 3 may be better than setting it to 10.
It follows that the empirical risk alone is not enough for model selection.

11.1 Model Selection Using SRM

145

In this chapter we will present two approaches for model selection. The ﬁrst
approach is based on the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) paradigm we
have described and analyzed in Chapter 7.2. SRM is particularly useful when
a learning algorithm depends on a parameter that controls the bias-complexity
tradeoﬀ (such as the degree of the ﬁtted polynomial in the preceding example
or the parameter T in AdaBoost). The second approach relies on the concept
of validation. The basic idea is to partition the training set into two sets. One
is used for training each of the candidate models, and the second is used for
deciding which of them yields the best results.

In model selection tasks, we try to ﬁnd the right balance between approxi-
mation and estimation errors. More generally, if our learning algorithm fails to
ﬁnd a predictor with a small risk, it is important to understand whether we
suﬀer from overﬁtting or underﬁtting. In Section 11.3 we discuss how this can
be achieved.

11.1

Model Selection Using SRM

The SRM paradigm has been described and analyzed in Section 7.2. Here we
show how SRM can be used for tuning the tradeoﬀ between bias and complexity
without deciding on a speciﬁc hypothesis class in advance. Consider a countable
sequence of hypothesis classes H1,H2,H3, . . .. For example, in the problem of
polynomial regression mentioned, we can take Hd to be the set of polynomials
of degree at most d. Another example is taking Hd to be the class L(B, d) used
by AdaBoost, as described in the previous chapter.
We assume that for every d, the class Hd enjoys the uniform convergence
property (see Deﬁnition 4.3 in Chapter 4) with a sample complexity function of
the form

(, δ) ≤ g(d) log(1/δ)

,

mUCHd

(11.1)
where g : N → R is some monotonically increasing function. For example, in the
case of binary classiﬁcation problems, we can take g(d) to be the VC-dimension
of the class Hd multiplied by a universal constant (the one appearing in the
fundamental theorem of learning; see Theorem 6.8). For the classes L(B, d) used
by AdaBoost, the function g will simply grow with d.

2

Recall that the SRM rule follows a “bound minimization” approach, where in
our case the bound is as follows: With probability of at least 1 − δ, for every
d ∈ N and h ∈ Hd,

(cid:114)

LD(h) ≤ LS(h) +

g(d)(log(1/δ) + 2 log(d) + log(π2/6))

m

.

(11.2)

This bound, which follows directly from Theorem 7.4, shows that for every d and
every h ∈ Hd, the true risk is bounded by two terms – the empirical risk, LS(h),

146

Model Selection and Validation

and a complexity term that depends on d. The SRM rule will search for d and
h ∈ Hd that minimize the right-hand side of Equation (11.2).

Getting back to the example of polynomial regression described earlier, even
though the empirical risk of the 10th degree polynomial is smaller than that of
the 3rd degree polynomial, we would still prefer the 3rd degree polynomial since
its complexity (as reﬂected by the value of the function g(d)) is much smaller.

While the SRM approach can be useful in some situations, in many practical
cases the upper bound given in Equation (11.2) is pessimistic. In the next section
we present a more practical approach.

11.2

Validation

We would often like to get a better estimation of the true risk of the output pre-
dictor of a learning algorithm. So far we have derived bounds on the estimation
error of a hypothesis class, which tell us that for all hypotheses in the class, the
true risk is not very far from the empirical risk. However, these bounds might be
loose and pessimistic, as they hold for all hypotheses and all possible data dis-
tributions. A more accurate estimation of the true risk can be obtained by using
some of the training data as a validation set, over which one can evalutate the
success of the algorithm’s output predictor. This procedure is called validation.
Naturally, a better estimation of the true risk is useful for model selection, as

we will describe in Section 11.2.2.

11.2.1

Hold Out Set

The simplest way to estimate the true error of a predictor h is by sampling an ad-
ditional set of examples, independent of the training set, and using the empirical
error on this validation set as our estimator. Formally, let V = (x1, y1), . . . , (xmv , ymv )
be a set of fresh mv examples that are sampled according to D (independently of
the m examples of the training set S). Using Hoeﬀding’s inequality ( Lemma 4.5)
we have the following:

theorem 11.1 Let h be some predictor and assume that the loss function is in
[0, 1]. Then, for every δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice
of a validation set V of size mv we have

(cid:115)

|LV (h) − LD(h)| ≤

log(2/δ)

2 mv

.

The bound in Theorem 11.1 does not depend on the algorithm or the training
set used to construct h and is tighter than the usual bounds that we have seen so
far. The reason for the tightness of this bound is that it is in terms of an estimate
on a fresh validation set that is independent of the way h was generated. To
illustrate this point, suppose that h was obtained by applying an ERM predictor

11.2 Validation

147

with respect to a hypothesis class of VC-dimension d, over a training set of m
examples. Then, from the fundamental theorem of learning (Theorem 6.8) we
obtain the bound

LD(h) ≤ LS(h) +

C

d + log(1/δ)

m

,

where C is the constant appearing in Theorem 6.8. In contrast, from Theo-
rem 11.1 we obtain the bound

(cid:114)

(cid:115)

LD(h) ≤ LV (h) +

log(2/δ)

2mv

.

Therefore, taking mv to be order of m, we obtain an estimate that is more
accurate by a factor that depends on the VC-dimension. On the other hand, the
price we pay for using such an estimate is that it requires an additional sample
on top of the sample used for training the learner.

Sampling a training set and then sampling an independent validation set is
equivalent to randomly partitioning our random set of examples into two parts,
using one part for training and the other one for validation. For this reason, the
validation set is often referred to as a hold out set.

11.2.2

Validation for Model Selection

Validation can be naturally used for model selection as follows. We ﬁrst train
diﬀerent algorithms (or the same algorithm with diﬀerent parameters) on the
given training set. Let H = {h1, . . . , hr} be the set of all output predictors of the
diﬀerent algorithms. For example, in the case of training polynomial regressors,
we would have each hr be the output of polynomial regression of degree r. Now,
to choose a single predictor from H we sample a fresh validation set and choose
the predictor that minimizes the error over the validation set. In other words,
we apply ERMH over the validation set.
This process is very similar to learning a ﬁnite hypothesis class. The only
diﬀerence is that H is not ﬁxed ahead of time but rather depends on the train-
ing set. However, since the validation set is independent of the training set we
get that it is also independent of H and therefore the same technique we used
to derive bounds for ﬁnite hypothesis classes holds here as well. In particular,
combining Theorem 11.1 with the union bound we obtain:
theorem 11.2 Let H = {h1, . . . , hr} be an arbitrary set of predictors and
assume that the loss function is in [0, 1]. Assume that a validation set V of size
mv is sampled independent of H. Then, with probability of at least 1− δ over the
choice of V we have

∀h ∈ H,

|LD(h) − LV (h)| ≤

(cid:115)

log(2|H|/δ)

2 mv

.

148

Model Selection and Validation

This theorem tells us that the error on the validation set approximates the
true error as long as H is not too large. However, if we try too many methods
(resulting in |H| that is large relative to the size of the validation set) then we’re
in danger of overﬁtting.

To illustrate how validation is useful for model selection, consider again the
example of ﬁtting a one dimensional polynomial as described in the beginning
of this chapter. In the following we depict the same training set, with ERM
polynomials of degree 2, 3, and 10, but this time we also depict an additional
validation set (marked as red, unﬁlled circles). The polynomial of degree 10 has
minimal training error, yet the polynomial of degree 3 has the minimal validation
error, and hence it will be chosen as the best model.

11.2.3

The Model-Selection Curve

The model selection curve shows the training error and validation error as a func-
tion of the complexity of the model considered. For example, for the polynomial
ﬁtting problem mentioned previously, the curve will look like:

11.2 Validation

As can be shown, the training error is monotonically decreasing as we increase
the polynomial degree (which is the complexity of the model in our case). On
the other hand, the validation error ﬁrst decreases but then starts to increase,
which indicates that we are starting to suﬀer from overﬁtting.

Plotting such curves can help us understand whether we are searching the
correct regime of our parameter space. Often, there may be more than a single
parameter to tune, and the possible number of values each parameter can take
might be quite large. For example, in Chapter 13 we describe the concept of
regularization, in which the parameter of the learning algorithm is a real number.
In such cases, we start with a rough grid of values for the parameter(s) and plot
the corresponding model-selection curve. On the basis of the curve we will zoom
in to the correct regime and employ a ﬁner grid to search over. It is important to
verify that we are in the relevant regime. For example, in the polynomial ﬁtting
problem described, if we start searching degrees from the set of values {1, 10, 20}
and do not employ a ﬁner grid based on the resulting curve, we will end up with
a rather poor model.

11.2.4

k-Fold Cross Validation

The validation procedure described so far assumes that data is plentiful and that
we have the ability to sample a fresh validation set. But in some applications,
data is scarce and we do not want to “waste” data on validation. The k-fold
cross validation technique is designed to give an accurate estimate of the true
error without wasting too much data.

In k-fold cross validation the original training set is partitioned into k subsets
(folds) of size m/k (for simplicity, assume that m/k is an integer). For each fold,
the algorithm is trained on the union of the other folds and then the error of its
output is estimated using the fold. Finally, the average of all these errors is the

150

Model Selection and Validation

estimate of the true error. The special case k = m, where m is the number of
examples, is called leave-one-out (LOO).

k-Fold cross validation is often used for model selection (or parameter tuning),
and once the best parameter is chosen, the algorithm is retrained using this
parameter on the entire training set. A pseudocode of k-fold cross validation
for model selection is given in the following. The procedure receives as input a
training set, S, a set of possible parameter values, Θ, an integer, k, representing
the number of folds, and a learning algorithm, A, which receives as input a
training set as well as a parameter θ ∈ Θ. It outputs the best parameter as well
as the hypothesis trained by this parameter on the entire training set.

The cross validation method often works very well in practice. However, it
might sometime fail, as the artiﬁcial example given in Exercise 1 shows. Rig-
orously understanding the exact behavior of cross validation is still an open
problem. Rogers and Wagner (Rogers & Wagner 1978) have shown that for k
local rules (e.g., k Nearest Neighbor; see Chapter 19) the cross validation proce-
dure gives a very good estimate of the true error. Other papers show that cross
validation works for stable algorithms (we will study stability and its relation to
learnability in Chapter 13).

11.2.5

Train-Validation-Test Split

In most practical applications, we split the available examples into three sets.
The ﬁrst set is used for training our algorithm and the second is used as a
validation set for model selection. After we select the best model, we test the
performance of the output predictor on the third set, which is often called the
“test set.” The number obtained is used as an estimator of the true error of the
learned predictor.

11.3 What to Do If Learning Fails

151

11.3 What to Do If Learning Fails

Consider the following scenario: You were given a learning task and have ap-
proached it with a choice of a hypothesis class, a learning algorithm, and param-
eters. You used a validation set to tune the parameters and tested the learned
predictor on a test set. The test results, unfortunately, turn out to be unsatis-
factory. What went wrong then, and what should you do next?

There are many elements that can be “ﬁxed.” The main approaches are listed

in the following:
• Get a larger sample
• Change the hypothesis class by:

– Enlarging it
– Reducing it
– Completely changing it
– Changing the parameters you consider
• Change the feature representation of the data
• Change the optimization algorithm used to apply your learning rule

In order to ﬁnd the best remedy, it is essential ﬁrst to understand the cause
of the bad performance. Recall that in Chapter 5 we decomposed the true er-
ror of the learned predictor into approximation error and estimation error. The
approximation error is deﬁned to be LD(h(cid:63)) for some h(cid:63) ∈ argminh∈H LD(h),
while the estimation error is deﬁned to be LD(hS) − LD(h(cid:63)), where hS is the
learned predictor (which is based on the training set S).

The approximation error of the class does not depend on the sample size or
on the algorithm being used. It only depends on the distribution D and on the
hypothesis class H. Therefore, if the approximation error is large, it will not help
us to enlarge the training set size, and it also does not make sense to reduce the
hypothesis class. What can be beneﬁcial in this case is to enlarge the hypothesis
class or completely change it (if we have some alternative prior knowledge in
the form of a diﬀerent hypothesis class). We can also consider applying the
same hypothesis class but on a diﬀerent feature representation of the data (see
Chapter 25).

The estimation error of the class does depend on the sample size. Therefore, if
we have a large estimation error we can make an eﬀort to obtain more training
examples. We can also consider reducing the hypothesis class. However, it doesn’t
make sense to enlarge the hypothesis class in that case.

Error Decomposition Using Validation
We see that understanding whether our problem is due to approximation error
or estimation error is very useful for ﬁnding the best remedy. In the previous
section we saw how to estimate LD(hS) using the empirical risk on a validation
set. However, it is more diﬃcult to estimate the approximation error of the class.

152

Model Selection and Validation

Instead, we give a diﬀerent error decomposition, one that can be estimated from
the train and validation sets.

LD(hS) = (LD(hS) − LV (hS)) + (LV (hS) − LS(hS)) + LS(hS).

The ﬁrst term, (LD(hS) − LV (hS)), can be bounded quite tightly using Theo-
rem 11.1. Intuitively, when the second term, (LV (hS) − LS(hS)), is large we say
that our algorithm suﬀers from “overﬁtting” while when the empirical risk term,
LS(hS), is large we say that our algorithm suﬀers from “underﬁtting.” Note that
these two terms are not necessarily good estimates of the estimation and ap-
proximation errors. To illustrate this, consider the case in which H is a class of
VC-dimension d, and D is a distribution such that the approximation error of H
with respect to D is 1/4. As long as the size of our training set is smaller than
d we will have LS(hS) = 0 for every ERM hypothesis. Therefore, the training
risk, LS(hS), and the approximation error, LD(h(cid:63)), can be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
Nevertheless, as we show later, the values of LS(hS) and (LV (hS)− LS(hS)) still
provide us useful information.

Consider ﬁrst the case in which LS(hS) is large. We can write

LS(hS) = (LS(hS) − LS(h(cid:63))) + (LS(h(cid:63)) − LD(h(cid:63))) + LD(h(cid:63)).

When hS is an ERMH hypothesis we have that LS(hS)−LS(h(cid:63)) ≤ 0. In addition,
since h(cid:63) does not depend on S, the term (LS(h(cid:63))−LD(h(cid:63))) can be bounded quite
tightly (as in Theorem 11.1). The last term is the approximation error. It follows
that if LS(hS) is large then so is the approximation error, and the remedy to the
failure of our algorithm should be tailored accordingly (as discussed previously).

Remark 11.1
It is possible that the approximation error of our class is small,
yet the value of LS(hS) is large. For example, maybe we had a bug in our ERM
implementation, and the algorithm returns a hypothesis hS that is not an ERM.
It may also be the case that ﬁnding an ERM hypothesis is computationally hard,
and our algorithm applies some heuristic trying to ﬁnd an approximate ERM. In
some cases, it is hard to know how good hS is relative to an ERM hypothesis. But,
sometimes it is possible at least to know whether there are better hypotheses.
For example, in the next chapter we will study convex learning problems in
which there are optimality conditions that can be checked to verify whether
our optimization algorithm converged to an ERM solution. In other cases, the
solution may depend on randomness in initializing the algorithm, so we can try
diﬀerent randomly selected initial points to see whether better solutions pop out.

Next consider the case in which LS(hS) is small. As we argued before, this
does not necessarily imply that the approximation error is small. Indeed, consider
two scenarios, in both of which we are trying to learn a hypothesis class of
VC-dimension d using the ERM learning rule. In the ﬁrst scenario, we have a
training set of m < d examples and the approximation error of the class is high.
In the second scenario, we have a training set of m > 2d examples and the

Figure 11.1 Examples of learning curves. Left: This learning curve corresponds to the
scenario in which the number of examples is always smaller than the VC dimension of
the class. Right: This learning curve corresponds to the scenario in which the
approximation error is zero and the number of examples is larger than the VC
dimension of the class.

approximation error of the class is zero. In both cases LS(hS) = 0. How can we
distinguish between the two cases?

Learning Curves
One possible way to distinguish between the two cases is by plotting learning
curves. To produce a learning curve we train the algorithm on preﬁxes of the
data of increasing sizes. For example, we can ﬁrst train the algorithm on the
ﬁrst 10% of the examples, then on 20% of them, and so on. For each preﬁx we
calculate the training error (on the preﬁx the algorithm is being trained on)
and the validation error (on a predeﬁned validation set). Such learning curves
can help us distinguish between the two aforementioned scenarios. In the ﬁrst
scenario we expect the validation error to be approximately 1/2 for all preﬁxes,
as we didn’t really learn anything. In the second scenario the validation error
will start as a constant but then should start decreasing (it must start decreasing
once the training set size is larger than the VC-dimension). An illustration of
the two cases is given in Figure 11.1.

In general, as long as the approximation error is greater than zero we expect
the training error to grow with the sample size, as a larger amount of data points
makes it harder to provide an explanation for all of them. On the other hand,
the validation error tends to decrease with the increase in sample size. If the
VC-dimension is ﬁnite, when the sample size goes to inﬁnity, the validation and
train errors converge to the approximation error. Therefore, by extrapolating
the training and validation curves we can try to guess the value of the approx-
imation error, or at least to get a rough estimate on an interval in which the
approximation error resides.

Getting back to the problem of ﬁnding the best remedy for the failure of
our algorithm, if we observe that LS(hS) is small while the validation error is
large, then in any case we know that the size of our training set is not suﬃcient
for learning the class H. We can then plot a learning curve. If we see that the

154

Model Selection and Validation

validation error is starting to decrease then the best solution is to increase the
number of examples (if we can aﬀord to enlarge the data). Another reasonable
solution is to decrease the complexity of the hypothesis class. On the other hand,
if we see that the validation error is kept around 1/2 then we have no evidence
that the approximation error of H is good. It may be the case that increasing
the training set size will not help us at all. Obtaining more data can still help
us, as at some point we can see whether the validation error starts to decrease
or whether the training error starts to increase. But, if more data is expensive,
it may be better ﬁrst to try to reduce the complexity of the hypothesis class.

To summarize the discussion, the following steps should be applied:

1. If learning involves parameter tuning, plot the model-selection curve to make

sure that you tuned the parameters appropriately (see Section 11.2.3).

2. If the training error is excessively large consider enlarging the hypothesis class,

completely change it, or change the feature representation of the data.

3. If the training error is small, plot learning curves and try to deduce from them

whether the problem is estimation error or approximation error.

4. If the approximation error seems to be small enough, try to obtain more data.
If this is not possible, consider reducing the complexity of the hypothesis class.
5. If the approximation error seems to be large as well, try to change the hy-

pothesis class or the feature representation of the data completely.

11.4

Summary

Model selection is the task of selecting an appropriate model for the learning
task based on the data itself. We have shown how this can be done using the
SRM learning paradigm or using the more practical approach of validation. If
our learning algorithm fails, a decomposition of the algorithm’s error should be
performed using learning curves, so as to ﬁnd the best remedy.

selection using validation. That is, ﬁrst train each class Hi on the (1 −
α)m training examples using the ERM rule with respect to Hi, and let
ˆh1, . . . , ˆhk be the resulting hypotheses. Second, apply the ERM rule with
respect to the ﬁnite class {ˆh1, . . . , ˆhk} on the αm validation examples.
Describe scenarios in which the ﬁrst method is better than the second and
vice versa.

12 Convex Learning Problems

In this chapter we introduce convex learning problems. Convex learning comprises
an important family of learning problems, mainly because most of what we can
learn eﬃciently falls into it. We have already encountered linear regression with
the squared loss and logistic regression, which are convex problems, and indeed
they can be learned eﬃciently. We have also seen nonconvex problems, such as
halfspaces with the 0-1 loss, which is known to be computationally hard to learn
in the unrealizable case.

In general, a convex learning problem is a problem whose hypothesis class is a
convex set, and whose loss function is a convex function for each example. We be-
gin the chapter with some required deﬁnitions of convexity. Besides convexity, we
will deﬁne Lipschitzness and smoothness, which are additional properties of the
loss function that facilitate successful learning. We next turn to deﬁning convex
learning problems and demonstrate the necessity for further constraints such as
Boundedness and Lipschitzness or Smoothness. We deﬁne these more restricted
families of learning problems and claim that Convex-Smooth/Lipschitz-Bounded
problems are learnable. These claims will be proven in the next two chapters, in
which we will present two learning paradigms that successfully learn all problems
that are either convex-Lipschitz-bounded or convex-smooth-bounded.

Finally, in Section 12.3, we show how one can handle some nonconvex problems
by minimizing “surrogate” loss functions that are convex (instead of the original
nonconvex loss function). Surrogate convex loss functions give rise to eﬃcient
solutions but might increase the risk of the learned predictor.

Convexity

definition 12.1 (Convex Set) A set C in a vector space is convex if for any
two vectors u, v in C, the line segment between u and v is contained in C. That
is, for any α ∈ [0, 1] we have that αu + (1 − α)v ∈ C.

Examples of convex and nonconvex sets in R2 are given in the following. For
the nonconvex sets, we depict two points in the set such that the line between
the two points is not contained in the set.

Given α ∈ [0, 1], the combination, αu + (1 − α)v of the points u, v is called a

convex combination.

definition 12.2 (Convex Function) Let C be a convex set. A function f :
C → R is convex if for every u, v ∈ C and α ∈ [0, 1],

f (αu + (1 − α)v) ≤ αf (u) + (1 − α)f (v) .

In words, f is convex if for any u, v, the graph of f between u and v lies below
the line segment joining f (u) and f (v). An illustration of a convex function,
f : R → R, is depicted in the following.

The epigraph of a function f is the set

epigraph(f) = {(x, β) : f (x) ≤ β}.

(12.1)

It is easy to verify that a function f is convex if and only if its epigraph is a
convex set. An illustration of a nonconvex function f : R → R, along with its
epigraph, is given in the following.

158

Convex Learning Problems

An important property of convex functions is that every local minimum of the
function is also a global minimum. Formally, let B(u, r) = {v : (cid:107)v − u(cid:107) ≤ r} be
a ball of radius r centered around u. We say that f (u) is a local minimum of f
at u if there exists some r > 0 such that for all v ∈ B(u, r) we have f (v) ≥ f (u).
It follows that for any v (not necessarily in B), there is a small enough α > 0
such that u + α(v − u) ∈ B(u, r) and therefore

f (u) ≤ f (u + α(v − u)) .

(12.2)

If f is convex, we also have that

f (u + α(v − u)) = f (αv + (1 − α)u) ≤ (1 − α)f (u) + αf (v) .

(12.3)

Combining these two equations and rearranging terms, we conclude that f (u) ≤
f (v). Since this holds for every v, it follows that f (u) is also a global minimum
of f .

Another important property of convex functions is that for every w we can
construct a tangent to f at w that lies below f everywhere. If f is diﬀerentiable,
this tangent is the linear function l(u) = f (w) + (cid:104)∇f (w), u − w(cid:105), where ∇f (w)
is the gradient of f at w, namely, the vector of partial derivatives of f , ∇f (w) =

. That is, for convex diﬀerentiable functions,

∀u, f (u) ≥ f (w) + (cid:104)∇f (w), u − w(cid:105).

f(cid:48), f(cid:48)(cid:48) be its ﬁrst and second derivatives, respectively. Then, the following are
equivalent:

1. f is convex
2. f(cid:48) is monotonically nondecreasing
3. f(cid:48)(cid:48) is nonnegative

Example 12.1
• The scalar function f (x) = x2 is convex. To see this, note that f(cid:48)(x) = 2x

and f(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) = 2 > 0.

• The scalar function f (x) = log(1 + exp(x)) is convex. To see this, observe that
exp(−x)+1 . This is a monotonically increasing function

f(cid:48)(x) = exp(x)
since the exponent function is a monotonically increasing function.

The following claim shows that the composition of a convex scalar function

with a linear function yields a convex vector-valued function.
claim 12.4 Assume that f : Rd → R can be written as f (w) = g((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + y),
for some x ∈ Rd, y ∈ R, and g : R → R. Then, convexity of g implies the
convexity of f .
Proof Let w1, w2 ∈ Rd and α ∈ [0, 1]. We have

f (αw1 + (1 − α)w2) = g((cid:104)αw1 + (1 − α)w2, x(cid:105) + y)

= g(α(cid:104)w1, x(cid:105) + (1 − α)(cid:104)w2, x(cid:105) + y)
= g(α((cid:104)w1, x(cid:105) + y) + (1 − α)((cid:104)w2, x(cid:105) + y))
≤ αg((cid:104)w1, x(cid:105) + y) + (1 − α)g((cid:104)w2, x(cid:105) + y),

where the last inequality follows from the convexity of g.

Example 12.2

Convex Learning Problems

• Given some x ∈ Rd and y ∈ R, let f : Rd → R be deﬁned as f (w) =
((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) − y)2. Then, f is a composition of the function g(a) = a2 onto a
linear function, and hence f is a convex function.

• Given some x ∈ Rd and y ∈ {±1}, let f : Rd → R be deﬁned as f (w) =
log(1 + exp(−y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105))). Then, f is a composition of the function g(a) =
log(1 + exp(a)) onto a linear function, and hence f is a convex function.

Finally, the following lemma shows that the maximum of convex functions is
convex and that a weighted sum of convex functions, with nonnegative weights,
is also convex.

12.1.2

Lipschitzness

The deﬁnition of Lipschitzness below is with respect to the Euclidean norm over
Rd. However, it is possible to deﬁne Lipschitzness with respect to any norm.
definition 12.6 (Lipschitzness) Let C ⊂ Rd. A function f : Rd → Rk is
ρ-Lipschitz over C if for every w1, w2 ∈ C we have that (cid:107)f (w1) − f (w2)(cid:107) ≤
ρ(cid:107)w1 − w2(cid:107).

12.1 Convexity, Lipschitzness, and Smoothness

161

Intuitively, a Lipschitz function cannot change too fast. Note that if f : R → R

is diﬀerentiable, then by the mean value theorem we have
f (w1) − f (w2) = f(cid:48)(u)(w1 − w2) ,

where u is some point between w1 and w2. It follows that if the derivative of f
is everywhere bounded (in absolute value) by ρ, then the function is ρ-Lipschitz.

Example 12.4
• The function f (x) = |x| is 1-Lipschitz over R. This follows from the triangle

inequality: For every x1, x2,
|x1| − |x2| = |x1 − x2 + x2| − |x2| ≤ |x1 − x2| + |x2| − |x2| = |x1 − x2|.
Since this holds for both x1, x2 and x2, x1, we obtain that ||x1| − |x2|| ≤
|x1 − x2|.
• The function f (x) = log(1 + exp(x)) is 1-Lipschitz over R. To see this, observe

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|f(cid:48)(x)| =

exp(x)

1 + exp(x)

1

exp(−x) + 1

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 1.

• The function f (x) = x2 is not ρ-Lipschitz over R for any ρ. To see this, take

x1 = 0 and x2 = 1 + ρ, then

f (x2) − f (x1) = (1 + ρ)2 > ρ(1 + ρ) = ρ|x2 − x1|.

However, this function is ρ-Lipschitz over the set C = {x : |x| ≤ ρ/2}.
Indeed, for any x1, x2 ∈ C we have

|x2
1 − x2

2| = |x1 + x2| |x1 − x2| ≤ 2(ρ/2)|x1 − x2| = ρ|x1 − x2|.

• The linear function f : Rd → R deﬁned by f (w) = (cid:104)v, w(cid:105) + b where v ∈ Rd

is (cid:107)v(cid:107)-Lipschitz. Indeed, using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,

|f (w1) − f (w2)| = |(cid:104)v, w1 − w2(cid:105)| ≤ (cid:107)v(cid:107)(cid:107)w1 − w2(cid:107).

The following claim shows that composition of Lipschitz functions preserves

Lipschitzness.

claim 12.7 Let f (x) = g1(g2(x)), where g1 is ρ1-Lipschitz and g2 is ρ2-
Lipschitz. Then, f is (ρ1ρ2)-Lipschitz. In particular, if g2 is the linear function,
g2(x) = (cid:104)v, x(cid:105) + b, for some v ∈ Rd, b ∈ R, then f is (ρ1 (cid:107)v(cid:107))-Lipschitz.

Proof

|f (w1) − f (w2)| = |g1(g2(w1)) − g1(g2(w2))|

≤ ρ1(cid:107)g2(w1) − g2(w2)(cid:107)
≤ ρ1 ρ2 (cid:107)w1 − w2(cid:107).

12.1.3

Smoothness

The deﬁnition of a smooth function relies on the notion of gradient. Recall that
the gradient of a diﬀerentiable function f : Rd → R at w, denoted ∇f (w), is the
vector of partial derivatives of f , namely, ∇f (w) =
definition 12.8 (Smoothness) A diﬀerentiable function f : Rd → R is β-
smooth if its gradient is β-Lipschitz; namely, for all v, w we have (cid:107)∇f (v) −
∇f (w)(cid:107) ≤ β(cid:107)v − w(cid:107).

It is possible to show that smoothness implies that for all v, w we have

f (v) ≤ f (w) + (cid:104)∇f (w), v − w(cid:105) +

(12.5)
Recall that convexity of f implies that f (v) ≥ f (w)+(cid:104)∇f (w), v−w(cid:105). Therefore,
when a function is both convex and smooth, we have both upper and lower
bounds on the diﬀerence between the function and its ﬁrst order approximation.

If we further assume that f (v) ≥ 0 for all v we conclude that smoothness implies
the following:

(cid:107)∇f (w)(cid:107)2 ≤ 2βf (w) .

(12.6)

A function that satisﬁes this property is also called a self-bounded function.

Example 12.5
• The function f (x) = x2 is 2-smooth. This follows directly from the fact that
f(cid:48)(x) = 2x. Note that for this particular function Equation (12.5) and
Equation (12.6) hold with equality.

• The function f (x) = log(1 + exp(x)) is (1/4)-smooth. Indeed, since f(cid:48)(x) =

The following claim shows that a composition of a smooth scalar function over

Proof By the chain rule we have that ∇f (w) = g(cid:48)((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b)x, where g(cid:48) is the

we therefore obtain

Convex Learning Problems

Recall that in our general deﬁnition of learning (Deﬁnition 3.4 in Chapter 3), we
have a hypothesis class H, a set of examples Z, and a loss function (cid:96) : H × Z →
R+. So far in the book we have mainly thought of Z as being the product of an
instance space and a target space, Z = X ×Y, and H being a set of functions from
X to Y. However, H can be an arbitrary set. Indeed, throughout this chapter,
we consider hypothesis classes H that are subsets of the Euclidean space Rd.
That is, every hypothesis is some real-valued vector. We shall, therefore, denote
a hypothesis in H by w. Now we can ﬁnally deﬁne convex learning problems:
definition 12.10 (Convex Learning Problem) A learning problem, (H, Z, (cid:96)),
is called convex if the hypothesis class H is a convex set and for all z ∈ Z, the
loss function, (cid:96)(·, z), is a convex function (where, for any z, (cid:96)(·, z) denotes the
function f : H → R deﬁned by f (w) = (cid:96)(w, z)).

Example 12.7 (Linear Regression with the Squared Loss) Recall that linear
regression is a tool for modeling the relationship between some “explanatory”
variables and some real valued outcome (see Chapter 9). The domain set X
is a subset of Rd, for some d, and the label set Y is the set of real numbers.
We would like to learn a linear function h : Rd → R that best approximates
the relationship between our variables. In Chapter 9 we deﬁned the hypothesis
class as the set of homogenous linear functions, H = {x (cid:55)→ (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) : w ∈ Rd},
and used the squared loss function, (cid:96)(h, (x, y)) = (h(x) − y)2. However, we can
equivalently model the learning problem as a convex learning problem as follows.

164

Convex Learning Problems

Each linear function is parameterized by a vector w ∈ Rd. Hence, we can deﬁne
H to be the set of all such parameters, namely, H = Rd. The set of examples is
Z = X ×Y = Rd×R = Rd+1, and the loss function is (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = ((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)−y)2.
Clearly, the set H is a convex set. The loss function is also convex with respect
to its ﬁrst argument (see Example 12.2).

If (cid:96) is a convex loss function and the class H is convex, then the
lemma 12.11
ERMH problem, of minimizing the empirical loss over H, is a convex optimiza-
tion problem (that is, a problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex
set).

Proof Recall that the ERMH problem is deﬁned by

ERMH(S) = argmin
w∈H

LS(w).

(cid:80)m

Since, for a sample S = z1, . . . , zm, for every w, LS(w) = 1
i=1 (cid:96)(w, zi),
m
Claim 12.5 implies that LS(w) is a convex function. Therefore, the ERM rule
is a problem of minimizing a convex function subject to the constraint that the
solution should be in a convex set.

Under mild conditions, such problems can be solved eﬃciently using generic
optimization algorithms. In particular, in Chapter 14 we will present a very
simple algorithm for minimizing convex functions.

12.2.1

Learnability of Convex Learning Problems

We have argued that for many cases, implementing the ERM rule for convex
learning problems can be done eﬃciently. But is convexity a suﬃcient condition
for the learnability of a problem?

To make the quesion more speciﬁc: In VC theory, we saw that halfspaces in
d-dimension are learnable (perhaps ineﬃciently). We also argued in Chapter 9
using the “discretization trick” that if the problem is of d parameters, it is
learnable with a sample complexity being a function of d. That is, for a constant
d, the problem should be learnable. So, maybe all convex learning problems over
Rd, are learnable?

Example 12.8 later shows that the answer is negative, even when d is low. Not
all convex learning problems over Rd are learnable. There is no contradiction
to VC theory since VC theory only deals with binary classiﬁcation while here
we consider a wide family of problems. There is also no contradiction to the
“discretization trick” as there we assumed that the loss function is bounded and
also assumed that a representation of each parameter using a ﬁnite number of
bits suﬃces. As we will show later, under some additional restricting conditions
that hold in many practical scenarios, convex problems are learnable.
Example 12.8 (Nonlearnability of Linear Regression Even If d = 1) Let H = R,
and the loss be the squared loss: (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = (wx − y)2 (we’re referring to the

homogenous case). Let A be any deterministic algorithm.1 Assume, by way of
contradiction, that A is a successful PAC learner for this problem. That is, there
exists a function m(·,·), such that for every distribution D and for every , δ if
A receives a training set of size m ≥ m(, δ), it should output, with probability
of at least 1 − δ, a hypothesis ˆw = A(S), such that LD( ˆw) − minw LD(w) ≤ .
. We will
deﬁne two distributions, and will show that A is likely to fail on at least one
of them. The ﬁrst distribution, D1, is supported on two examples, z1 = (1, 0)
and z2 = (µ,−1), where the probability mass of the ﬁrst example is µ while the
probability mass of the second example is 1 − µ. The second distribution, D2, is
supported entirely on z2.

2m

Observe that for both distributions, the probability that all examples of the
training set will be of the second type is at least 99%. This is trivially true for
D2, whereas for D1, the probability of this event is
(1 − µ)m ≥ e−2µm = 0.99.

Since we assume that A is a deterministic algorithm, upon receiving a training
set of m examples, each of which is (µ,−1), the algorithm will output some ˆw.
Now, if ˆw < −1/(2µ), we will set the distribution to be D1. Hence,

LD1( ˆw) ≥ µ( ˆw)2 ≥ 1/(4µ).

LD1 (w) ≤ LD1 (0) = (1 − µ).

However,

It follows that

Therefore, such algorithm A fails on D1. On the other hand, if ˆw ≥ −1/(2µ)
then we’ll set the distribution to be D2. Then we have that LD2( ˆw) ≥ 1/4 while
minw LD2(w) = 0, so A fails on D2. In summary, we have shown that for every
A there exists a distribution on which A fails, which implies that the problem is
not PAC learnable.

A possible solution to this problem is to add another constraint on the hypoth-
esis class. In addition to the convexity requirement, we require that H will be
bounded ; namely, we assume that for some predeﬁned scalar B, every hypothesis
w ∈ H satisﬁes (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B.

Boundedness and convexity alone are still not suﬃcient for ensuring that the

problem is learnable, as the following example demonstrates.

Example 12.9 As in Example 12.8, consider a regression problem with the
squared loss. However, this time let H = {w : |w| ≤ 1} ⊂ R be a bounded

simplicity. A slightly more involved argument will show that nondeterministic algorithms
will also fail to learn the problem.

Convex Learning Problems

hypothesis class. It is easy to verify that H is convex. The argument will be
the same as in Example 12.8, except that now the two distributions, D1,D2 will
be supported on z1 = (1/µ, 0) and z2 = (1,−1). If the algorithm A returns
ˆw < −1/2 upon receiving m examples of the second type, then we will set the
distribution to be D1 and have that

LD1( ˆw) − min

LD1(w) ≥ µ( ˆw/µ)2 − LD1 (0) ≥ 1/(4µ) − (1 − µ) > .
Similarly, if ˆw ≥ −1/2 we will set the distribution to be D2 and have that

LD2( ˆw) − min

LD2(w) ≥ (−1/2 + 1)2 − 0 > .

This example shows that we need additional assumptions on the learning
problem, and this time the solution is in Lipschitzness or smoothness of the
loss function. This motivates a deﬁnition of two families of learning problems,
convex-Lipschitz-bounded and convex-smooth-bounded, which are deﬁned later.

12.2.2

Convex-Lipschitz/Smooth-Bounded Learning Problems

definition 12.12 (Convex-Lipschitz-Bounded Learning Problem) A learning
problem, (H, Z, (cid:96)), is called Convex-Lipschitz-Bounded, with parameters ρ, B if
the following holds:
• The hypothesis class H is a convex set and for all w ∈ H we have (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B.
• For all z ∈ Z, the loss function, (cid:96)(·, z), is a convex and ρ-Lipschitz function.

Example 12.10 Let X = {x ∈ Rd : (cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ ρ} and Y = R. Let H = {w ∈ Rd :
(cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B} and let the loss function be (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) − y|. This corre-
sponds to a regression problem with the absolute-value loss, where we assume
that the instances are in a ball of radius ρ and we restrict the hypotheses to be
homogenous linear functions deﬁned by a vector w whose norm is bounded by
B. Then, the resulting problem is Convex-Lipschitz-Bounded with parameters
ρ, B.

definition 12.13 (Convex-Smooth-Bounded Learning Problem) A learning
problem, (H, Z, (cid:96)), is called Convex-Smooth-Bounded, with parameters β, B if
the following holds:
• The hypothesis class H is a convex set and for all w ∈ H we have (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B.
• For all z ∈ Z, the loss function, (cid:96)(·, z), is a convex, nonnegative, and β-smooth

function.

Note that we also required that the loss function is nonnegative. This is needed
to ensure that the loss function is self-bounded, as described in the previous
section.

12.3 Surrogate Loss Functions

167

Example 12.11 Let X = {x ∈ Rd : (cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ β/2} and Y = R. Let H = {w ∈
Rd : (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B} and let the loss function be (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = ((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) − y)2. This
corresponds to a regression problem with the squared loss, where we assume that
the instances are in a ball of radius β/2 and we restrict the hypotheses to be
homogenous linear functions deﬁned by a vector w whose norm is bounded by B.
Then, the resulting problem is Convex-Smooth-Bounded with parameters β, B.

We claim that these two families of learning problems are learnable. That is,
the properties of convexity, boundedness, and Lipschitzness or smoothness of the
loss function are suﬃcient for learnability. We will prove this claim in the next
chapters by introducing algorithms that learn these problems successfully.

12.3

Surrogate Loss Functions

As mentioned, and as we will see in the next chapters, convex problems can
be learned eﬀﬁciently. However, in many cases, the natural loss function is not
convex and, in particular, implementing the ERM rule is hard.

As an example, consider the problem of learning the hypothesis class of half-

spaces with respect to the 0 − 1 loss. That is,

(cid:96)0−1(w, (x, y)) = 1[y(cid:54)=sign((cid:104)w,x(cid:105))] = 1[y(cid:104)w,x(cid:105)≤0].

This loss function is not convex with respect to w and indeed, when trying to
minimize the empirical risk with respect to this loss function we might encounter
local minima (see Exercise 1). Furthermore, as discussed in Chapter 8, solving
the ERM problem with respect to the 0− 1 loss in the unrealizable case is known
to be NP-hard.

To circumvent the hardness result, one popular approach is to upper bound
the nonconvex loss function by a convex surrogate loss function. As its name
indicates, the requirements from a convex surrogate loss are as follows:

1. It should be convex.

2. It should upper bound the original loss.

For example, in the context of learning halfspaces, we can deﬁne the so-called
hinge loss as a convex surrogate for the 0 − 1 loss, as follows:
(cid:96)hinge(w, (x, y)) def= max{0, 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)}.

Clearly, for all w and all (x, y), (cid:96)0−1(w, (x, y)) ≤ (cid:96)hinge(w, (x, y)). In addition,
the convexity of the hinge loss follows directly from Claim 12.5. Hence, the hinge
loss satisﬁes the requirements of a convex surrogate loss function for the zero-one
loss. An illustration of the functions (cid:96)0−1 and (cid:96)hinge is given in the following.

Once we have deﬁned the surrogate convex loss, we can learn the problem with
respect to it. The generalization requirement from a hinge loss learner will have
the form

LhingeD

(A(S)) ≤ min

w∈H LhingeD

(w) + ,

where LhingeD
can lower bound the left-hand side by L0−1D (A(S)), which yields

(w) = E(x,y)∼D[(cid:96)hinge(w, (x, y))]. Using the surrogate property, we

w∈H LhingeD

That is, the 0−1 error of the learned predictor is upper bounded by three terms:
• Approximation error : This is the term minw∈H L0−1D (w), which measures how
well the hypothesis class performs on the distribution. We already elabo-
rated on this error term in Chapter 5.
• Estimation error : This is the error that results from the fact that we only
receive a training set and do not observe the distribution D. We already
elaborated on this error term in Chapter 5.

to the surrogate loss and the approximation error with respect to the orig-

training loss with respect to the original loss. The size of this error depends
on the speciﬁc distribution of the data and on the speciﬁc surrogate loss
we are using.

surrogate loss function, which enables us also to utilize the convex machinery for
nonconvex problems.

Bibliographic Remarks

12.6

There are several excellent books on convex analysis and optimization (Boyd &
Vandenberghe 2004, Borwein & Lewis 2006, Bertsekas 1999, Hiriart-Urruty &
Lemar´echal 1996). Regarding learning problems, the family of convex-Lipschitz-
bounded problems was ﬁrst studied by Zinkevich (2003) in the context of online
learning and by Shalev-Shwartz, Shamir, Sridharan & Srebro (2009) in the con-
text of PAC learning.

Exercises
1. Construct an example showing that the 0−1 loss function may suﬀer from
local minima; namely, construct a training sample S ∈ (X ×{±1})m (say, for
X = R2), for which there exist a vector w and some  > 0 such that
1. For any w(cid:48) such that (cid:107)w − w(cid:48)(cid:107) ≤  we have LS(w) ≤ LS(w(cid:48)) (where the
loss here is the 0−1 loss). This means that w is a local minimum of LS.
2. There exists some w∗ such that LS(w∗) < LS(w). This means that w is
2. Consider the learning problem of logistic regression: Let H = X = {x ∈
Rd : (cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ B}, for some scalar B > 0, let Y = {±1}, and let the loss
function (cid:96) be deﬁned as (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = log(1 + exp(−y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105))). Show that
the resulting learning problem is both convex-Lipschitz-bounded and convex-
smooth-bounded. Specify the parameters of Lipschitzness and smoothness.
3. Consider the problem of learning halfspaces with the hinge loss. We limit our
domain to the Euclidean ball with radius R. That is, X = {x : (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 ≤ R}.
The label set is Y = {±1} and the loss function (cid:96) is deﬁned by (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) =
max{0, 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)}. We already know that the loss function is convex. Show
that it is R-Lipschitz.

4. (*) Convex-Lipschitz-Boundedness Is Not Suﬃcient for Computa-
tional Eﬃciency:
In the next chapter we show that from the statistical
perspective, all convex-Lipschitz-bounded problems are learnable (in the ag-
nostic PAC model). However, our main motivation to learn such problems
resulted from the computational perspective – convex optimization is often
eﬃciently solvable. Yet the goal of this exercise is to show that convexity
alone is not suﬃcient for eﬃciency. We show that even for the case d = 1,
there is a convex-Lipschitz-bounded problem which cannot be learned by any
computable learner.
Let the hypothesis class be H = [0, 1] and let the example domain, Z, be

the set of all Turing machines. Deﬁne the loss function as follows. For every
Turing machine T ∈ Z, let (cid:96)(0, T ) = 1 if T halts on the input 0 and (cid:96)(0, T ) = 0
if T doesn’t halt on the input 0. Similarly, let (cid:96)(1, T ) = 0 if T halts on the
input 0 and (cid:96)(1, T ) = 1 if T doesn’t halt on the input 0. Finally, for h ∈ (0, 1),
let (cid:96)(h, T ) = h(cid:96)(0, T ) + (1 − h)(cid:96)(1, T ).
1. Show that the resulting learning problem is convex-Lipschitz-bounded.
2. Show that no computable algorithm can learn the problem.

13 Regularization and Stability

In the previous chapter we introduced the families of convex-Lipschitz-bounded
and convex-smooth-bounded learning problems. In this section we show that all
learning problems in these two families are learnable. For some learning problems
of this type it is possible to show that uniform convergence holds; hence they
are learnable using the ERM rule. However, this is not true for all learning
problems of this type. Yet, we will introduce another learning rule and will show
that it learns all convex-Lipschitz-bounded and convex-smooth-bounded learning
problems.

The new learning paradigm we introduce in this chapter is called Regularized
Loss Minimization, or RLM for short. In RLM we minimize the sum of the em-
pirical risk and a regularization function. Intuitively, the regularization function
measures the complexity of hypotheses. Indeed, one interpretation of the reg-
ularization function is the structural risk minimization paradigm we discussed
in Chapter 7. Another view of regularization is as a stabilizer of the learning
algorithm. An algorithm is considered stable if a slight change of its input does
not change its output much. We will formally deﬁne the notion of stability (what
we mean by “slight change of input” and by “does not change much the out-
put”) and prove its close relation to learnability. Finally, we will show that using
the squared (cid:96)2 norm as a regularization function stabilizes all convex-Lipschitz or
convex-smooth learning problems. Hence, RLM can be used as a general learning
rule for these families of learning problems.

13.1

Regularized Loss Minimization

Regularized Loss Minimization (RLM) is a learning rule in which we jointly min-
imize the empirical risk and a regularization function. Formally, a regularization
function is a mapping R : Rd → R, and the regularized loss minimization rule
outputs a hypothesis in

argmin

w

(LS(w) + R(w)) .

(13.1)

Regularized loss minimization shares similarities with minimum description length
algorithms and structural risk minimization (see Chapter 7). Intuitively, the
“complexity” of hypotheses is measured by the value of the regularization func-

tion, and the algorithm balances between low empirical risk and “simpler,” or
“less complex,” hypotheses.

There are many possible regularization functions one can use, reﬂecting some
prior belief about the problem (similarly to the description language in Minimum
Description Length). Throughout this section we will focus on one of the most
simple regularization functions: R(w) = λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2, where λ > 0 is a scalar and the
norm is the (cid:96)2 norm, (cid:107)w(cid:107) =

i . This yields the learning rule:

(cid:113)(cid:80)d

i=1 w2

(cid:0)LS(w) + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2(cid:1) .

A(S) = argmin

w

(13.2)

This type of regularization function is often called Tikhonov regularization.

As mentioned before, one interpretation of Equation (13.2) is using structural
risk minimization, where the norm of w is a measure of its “complexity.” Recall
that in the previous chapter we introduced the notion of bounded hypothesis
classes. Therefore, we can deﬁne a sequence of hypothesis classes, H1 ⊂ H2 ⊂
H3 . . ., where Hi = {w : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ i}. If the sample complexity of each Hi depends
on i then the RLM rule is similar to the SRM rule for this sequence of nested
classes.

A diﬀerent interpretation of regularization is as a stabilizer. In the next section
we deﬁne the notion of stability and prove that stable learning rules do not
overﬁt. But ﬁrst, let us demonstrate the RLM rule for linear regression with the
squared loss.

13.1.1

Ridge Regression

Applying the RLM rule with Tikhonov regularization to linear regression with
the squared loss, we obtain the following learning rule:

(13.3)

Performing linear regression using Equation (13.3) is called ridge regression.

To solve Equation (13.3) we compare the gradient of the objective to zero and

obtain the set of linear equations

where I is the identity matrix and A, b are as deﬁned in Equation (9.6), namely,

and

b =

Since A is a positive semideﬁnite matrix, the matrix 2λmI + A has all its eigen-
values bounded below by 2λm. Hence, this matrix is invertible and the solution
to ridge regression becomes

w = (2λmI + A)−1 b.

(13.5)

13.2 Stable Rules Do Not Overﬁt

173

In the next section we formally show how regularization stabilizes the algo-
rithm and prevents overﬁtting. In particular, the analysis presented in the next
sections (particularly, Corollary 13.11) will yield:
theorem 13.1 Let D be a distribution over X × [−1, 1], where X = {x ∈
Rd : (cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ 1}. Let H = {w ∈ Rd : (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B}. For any  ∈ (0, 1), let m ≥
150 B2/2. Then, applying the ridge regression algorithm with parameter λ =
/(3B2) satisﬁes

w∈H LD(w) + .

Remark 13.1 The preceding theorem tells us how many examples are needed
to guarantee that the expected value of the risk of the learned predictor will be
bounded by the approximation error of the class plus . In the usual deﬁnition
of agnostic PAC learning we require that the risk of the learned predictor will
be bounded with probability of at least 1 − δ. In Exercise 1 we show how an
algorithm with a bounded expected risk can be used to construct an agnostic
PAC learner.

13.2

Stable Rules Do Not Overﬁt

Intuitively, a learning algorithm is stable if a small change of the input to the
algorithm does not change the output of the algorithm much. Of course, there
are many ways to deﬁne what we mean by “a small change of the input” and
what we mean by “does not change the output much”. In this section we deﬁne
a speciﬁc notion of stability and prove that under this deﬁnition, stable rules do
not overﬁt.

Let A be a learning algorithm, let S = (z1, . . . , zm) be a training set of m
examples, and let A(S) denote the output of A. The algorithm A suﬀers from
overﬁtting if the diﬀerence between the true risk of its output, LD(A(S)), and the
empirical risk of its output, LS(A(S)), is large. As mentioned in Remark 13.1,
throughout this chapter we focus on the expectation (with respect to the choice
of S) of this quantity, namely, ES[LD(A(S)) − LS(A(S))].
We next deﬁne the notion of stability. Given the training set S and an ad-
ditional example z(cid:48), let S(i) be the training set obtained by replacing the i’th
example of S with z(cid:48); namely, S(i) = (z1, . . . , zi−1, z(cid:48), zi+1, . . . , zm). In our deﬁ-
nition of stability, “a small change of the input” means that we feed A with S(i)
instead of with S. That is, we only replace one training example. We measure
the eﬀect of this small change of the input on the output of A, by comparing
the loss of the hypothesis A(S) on zi to the loss of the hypothesis A(S(i)) on zi.
Intuitively, a good learning algorithm will have (cid:96)(A(S(i)), zi) − (cid:96)(A(S), zi) ≥ 0,
since in the ﬁrst term the learning algorithm does not observe the example zi
while in the second term zi is indeed observed. If the preceding diﬀerence is very
large we suspect that the learning algorithm might overﬁt. This is because the

174

Regularization and Stability

learning algorithm drastically changes its prediction on zi if it observes it in the
training set. This is formalized in the following theorem.
theorem 13.2 Let D be a distribution. Let S = (z1, . . . , zm) be an i.i.d. se-
quence of examples and let z(cid:48) be another i.i.d. example. Let U (m) be the uniform
distribution over [m]. Then, for any learning algorithm,

(S,z(cid:48))∼Dm+1,i∼U (m)

[(cid:96)(A(S(i), zi)) − (cid:96)(A(S), zi)].
(13.6)

Proof Since S and z(cid:48) are both drawn i.i.d. from D, we have that for every i,

E
[LD(A(S))] = E
S

S,z(cid:48)[(cid:96)(A(S), z(cid:48))] = E

S,z(cid:48)[(cid:96)(A(S(i)), zi)].

On the other hand, we can write

E
[LS(A(S))] = E
S

S,i

[(cid:96)(A(S), zi)].

Combining the two equations we conclude our proof.

When the right-hand side of Equation (13.6) is small, we say that A is a stable
algorithm – changing a single example in the training set does not lead to a
signiﬁcant change. Formally,
definition 13.3 (On-Average-Replace-One-Stable) Let  : N → R be a mono-
tonically decreasing function. We say that a learning algorithm A is on-average-
replace-one-stable with rate (m) if for every distribution D

E

(S,z(cid:48))∼Dm+1,i∼U (m)

[(cid:96)(A(S(i), zi)) − (cid:96)(A(S), zi)] ≤ (m).

Theorem 13.2 tells us that a learning algorithm does not overﬁt if and only
if it is on-average-replace-one-stable. Of course, a learning algorithm that does
not overﬁt is not necessarily a good learning algorithm – take, for example, an
algorithm A that always outputs the same hypothesis. A useful algorithm should
ﬁnd a hypothesis that on one hand ﬁts the training set (i.e., has a low empirical
risk) and on the other hand does not overﬁt. Or, in light of Theorem 13.2, the
algorithm should both ﬁt the training set and at the same time be stable. As we
shall see, the parameter λ of the RLM rule balances between ﬁtting the training
set and being stable.

13.3

Tikhonov Regularization as a Stabilizer

In the previous section we saw that stable rules do not overﬁt. In this section we
show that applying the RLM rule with Tikhonov regularization, λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2, leads to
a stable algorithm. We will assume that the loss function is convex and that it
is either Lipschitz or smooth.

The main property of the Tikhonov regularization that we rely on is that it

makes the objective of RLM strongly convex, as deﬁned in the following.

13.3 Tikhonov Regularization as a Stabilizer

175

definition 13.4 (Strongly Convex Functions) A function f is λ-strongly con-
vex if for all w, u and α ∈ (0, 1) we have

f (αw + (1 − α)u) ≤ αf (w) + (1 − α)f (u) − λ
2

α(1 − α)(cid:107)w − u(cid:107)2.

Clearly, every convex function is 0-strongly convex. An illustration of strong

convexity is given in the following ﬁgure.

f (u)

f (w)

2 α(1 − α)(cid:107)u − w(cid:107)2

u

The following lemma implies that the objective of RLM is (2λ)-strongly con-

vex. In addition, it underscores an important property of strong convexity.

lemma 13.5
1. The function f (w) = λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 is 2λ-strongly convex.
2. If f is λ-strongly convex and g is convex, then f + g is λ-strongly convex.
3. If f is λ-strongly convex and u is a minimizer of f , then, for any w,

f (w) − f (u) ≥ λ
2

(cid:107)w − u(cid:107)2.

Proof The ﬁrst two points follow directly from the deﬁnition. To prove the last
point, we divide the deﬁnition of strong convexity by α and rearrange terms to
get that

f (u + α(w − u)) − f (u)

α

≤ f (w) − f (u) − λ
2

(1 − α)(cid:107)w − u(cid:107)2.

Taking the limit α → 0 we obtain that the right-hand side converges to f (w) −
f (u)− λ
2(cid:107)w− u(cid:107)2. On the other hand, the left-hand side becomes the derivative
of the function g(α) = f (u + α(w − u)) at α = 0. Since u is a minimizer of f ,
it follows that α = 0 is a minimizer of g, and therefore the left-hand side of the
preceding goes to zero in the limit α → 0, which concludes our proof.

We now turn to prove that RLM is stable. Let S = (z1, . . . , zm) be a training
set, let z(cid:48) be an additional example, and let S(i) = (z1, . . . , zi−1, z(cid:48), zi+1, . . . , zm).
Let A be the RLM rule, namely,

(cid:0)LS(w) + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2(cid:1) .

A(S) = argmin

w

176

Regularization and Stability

Denote fS(w) = LS(w) + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2, and based on Lemma 13.5 we know that fS is
(2λ)-strongly convex. Relying on part 3 of the lemma, it follows that for any v,

fS(v) − fS(A(S)) ≥ λ(cid:107)v − A(S)(cid:107)2.

On the other hand, for any v and u, and for all i, we have

fS(v) − fS(u) = LS(v) + λ(cid:107)v(cid:107)2 − (LS(u) + λ(cid:107)u(cid:107)2)

= LS(i)(v) + λ(cid:107)v(cid:107)2 − (LS(i) (u) + λ(cid:107)u(cid:107)2)

In particular, choosing v = A(S(i)), u = A(S), and using the fact that v mini-
mizes LS(i) (w) + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2, we obtain that
fS(A(S(i)))−fS(A(S)) ≤ (cid:96)(A(S(i)), zi) − (cid:96)(A(S), zi)

The two subsections that follow continue the stability analysis for either Lip-
schitz or smooth loss functions. For both families of loss functions we show that
RLM is stable and therefore it does not overﬁt.

13.3.1

Lipschitz Loss
If the loss function, (cid:96)(·, zi), is ρ-Lipschitz, then by the deﬁnition of Lipschitzness,

(cid:96)(A(S(i)), zi) − (cid:96)(A(S), zi) ≤ ρ(cid:107)A(S(i)) − A(S)(cid:107).

(13.11)

Similarly,

(cid:96)(A(S), z(cid:48)) − (cid:96)(A(S(i)), z(cid:48)) ≤ ρ(cid:107)A(S(i)) − A(S)(cid:107).

Plugging these inequalities into Equation (13.10) we obtain

λ(cid:107)A(S(i)) − A(S)(cid:107)2 ≤ 2 ρ(cid:107)A(S(i)) − A(S)(cid:107)

which yields

(cid:107)A(S(i)) − A(S)(cid:107) ≤ 2 ρ

Plugging the preceding back into Equation (13.11) we conclude that

(cid:96)(A(S(i)), zi) − (cid:96)(A(S), zi) ≤ 2 ρ2

Since this holds for any S, z(cid:48), i we immediately obtain:

corollary 13.7 Assume that the loss function is β-smooth and nonnegative.
Then, the RLM rule with the regularizer λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2, where λ ≥ 2β

(13.15)

The ﬁrst term reﬂects how well A(S) ﬁts the training set while the second term
reﬂects the diﬀerence between the true and empirical risks of A(S). As we have
shown in Theorem 13.2, the second term is equivalent to the stability of A. Since
our goal is to minimize the risk of the algorithm, we need that the sum of both
terms will be small.

In the previous section we have bounded the stability term. We have shown
that the stability term decreases as the regularization parameter, λ, increases.
On the other hand, the empirical risk increases with λ. We therefore face a

13.4 Controlling the Fitting-Stability Tradeoﬀ

tradeoﬀ between ﬁtting and overﬁtting. This tradeoﬀ is quite similar to the bias-
complexity tradeoﬀ we discussed previously in the book.

We now derive bounds on the empirical risk term for the RLM rule. Recall

(cid:0)LS(w) + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2(cid:1). Fix some

that the RLM rule is deﬁned as A(S) = argminw
arbitrary vector w∗. We have

LS(A(S)) ≤ LS(A(S)) + λ(cid:107)A(S)(cid:107)2 ≤ LS(w∗) + λ(cid:107)w∗(cid:107)2.

Taking expectation of both sides with respect to S and noting that ES[LS(w∗)] =
LD(w∗), we obtain that
[LS(A(S))] ≤ LD(w∗) + λ(cid:107)w∗(cid:107)2.
E

Plugging this into Equation (13.15) we obtain

[LD(A(S)) − LS(A(S))].

Combining the preceding with Corollary 13.6 we conclude:

corollary 13.8 Assume that the loss function is convex and ρ-Lipschitz.
Then, the RLM rule with the regularization function λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 satisﬁes

∀w∗, E

[LD(A(S))] ≤ LD(w∗) + λ(cid:107)w∗(cid:107)2 +

This bound is often called an oracle inequality – if we think of w∗ as a hy-
pothesis with low risk, the bound tells us how many examples are needed so that
A(S) will be almost as good as w∗, had we known the norm of w∗. In practice,
however, we usually do not know the norm of w∗. We therefore usually tune λ
on the basis of a validation set, as described in Chapter 11.

We can also easily derive a PAC-like guarantee1 from Corollary 13.8 for convex-

Lipschitz-bounded learning problems:

The preceding corollary holds for Lipschitz loss functions. If instead the loss
function is smooth and nonnegative, then we can combine Equation (13.16) with

Summary

We introduced stability and showed that if an algorithm is stable then it does not
overﬁt. Furthermore, for convex-Lipschitz-bounded or convex-smooth-bounded
problems, the RLM rule with Tikhonov regularization leads to a stable learning
algorithm. We discussed how the regularization parameter, λ, controls the trade-
oﬀ between ﬁtting and overﬁtting. Finally, we have shown that all learning prob-
lems that are from the families of convex-Lipschitz-bounded and convex-smooth-
bounded problems are learnable using the RLM rule. The RLM paradigm is the
basis for many popular learning algorithms, including ridge regression (which we
discussed in this chapter) and support vector machines (which will be discussed
in Chapter 15).

In the next chapter we will present Stochastic Gradient Descent, which gives us
a very practical alternative way to learn convex-Lipschitz-bounded and convex-
smooth-bounded problems and can also be used for eﬃciently implementing the
RLM rule.

13.6

Bibliographic Remarks

Stability is widely used in many mathematical contexts. For example, the neces-
sity of stability for so-called inverse problems to be well posed was ﬁrst recognized
by Hadamard (1902). The idea of regularization and its relation to stability be-
came widely known through the works of Tikhonov (1943) and Phillips (1962).

13.7 Exercises

181

In the context of modern learning theory, the use of stability can be traced back
at least to the work of Rogers & Wagner (1978), which noted that the sensitiv-
ity of a learning algorithm with regard to small changes in the sample controls
the variance of the leave-one-out estimate. The authors used this observation to
obtain generalization bounds for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (see Chap-
ter 19). These results were later extended to other “local” learning algorithms
(see Devroye, Gy¨orﬁ & Lugosi (1996) and references therein). In addition, practi-
cal methods have been developed to introduce stability into learning algorithms,
in particular the Bagging technique introduced by (Breiman 1996).

Over the last decade, stability was studied as a generic condition for learnabil-
ity. See (Kearns & Ron 1999, Bousquet & Elisseeﬀ 2002, Kutin & Niyogi 2002,
Rakhlin, Mukherjee & Poggio 2005, Mukherjee, Niyogi, Poggio & Rifkin 2006).
Our presentation follows the work of Shalev-Shwartz, Shamir, Srebro & Sridha-
ran (2010), who showed that stability is suﬃcient and necessary for learning.
They have also shown that all convex-Lipschitz-bounded learning problems are
learnable using RLM, even though for some convex-Lipschitz-bounded learning
problems uniform convergence does not hold in a strong sense.

αi(xi − wi)2.

i=1

This problem corresponds to an unsupervised learning task, meaning that we
do not try to predict the label of x. Instead, what we try to do is to ﬁnd the
“center of mass” of the distribution over B. However, there is a twist, modeled
by the vectors α. Each example is a pair (x, α), where x is the instance x and
α indicates which features of x are “active” and which are “turned oﬀ.” A
hypothesis is a vector w representing the center of mass of the distribution,
and the loss function is the squared Euclidean distance between x and w, but
only with respect to the “active” elements of x.
• Show that this problem is learnable using the RLM rule with a sample

complexity that does not depend on d.

• Consider a distribution D over Z as follows: x is ﬁxed to be some x0, and
each element of α is sampled to be either 1 or 0 with equal probability.
Show that the rate of uniform convergence of this problem grows with
d.
Hint: Let m be a training set size. Show that if d (cid:29) 2m, then there is
a high probability of sampling a set of examples such that there exists
some j ∈ [d] for which αj = 1 for all the examples in the training set.
Show that such a sample cannot be -representative. Conclude that the
sample complexity of uniform convergence must grow with log(d).

• Conclude that if we take d to inﬁnity we obtain a problem that is learnable
but for which the uniform convergence property does not hold. Compare
to the fundamental theorem of statistical learning.

14 Stochastic Gradient Descent

Recall that the goal of learning is to minimize the risk function, LD(h) =
Ez∼D[(cid:96)(h, z)]. We cannot directly minimize the risk function since it depends
on the unknown distribution D. So far in the book, we have discussed learning
methods that depend on the empirical risk. That is, we ﬁrst sample a training
set S and deﬁne the empirical risk function LS(h). Then, the learner picks a
hypothesis based on the value of LS(h). For example, the ERM rule tells us to
pick the hypothesis that minimizes LS(h) over the hypothesis class, H. Or, in the
previous chapter, we discussed regularized risk minimization, in which we pick a
hypothesis that jointly minimizes LS(h) and a regularization function over h.

In this chapter we describe and analyze a rather diﬀerent learning approach,
which is called Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). As in Chapter 12 we will
focus on the important family of convex learning problems, and following the
notation in that chapter, we will refer to hypotheses as vectors w that come from
a convex hypothesis class, H. In SGD, we try to minimize the risk function LD(w)
directly using a gradient descent procedure. Gradient descent is an iterative
optimization procedure in which at each step we improve the solution by taking
a step along the negative of the gradient of the function to be minimized at
the current point. Of course, in our case, we are minimizing the risk function,
and since we do not know D we also do not know the gradient of LD(w). SGD
circumvents this problem by allowing the optimization procedure to take a step
along a random direction, as long as the expected value of the direction is the
negative of the gradient. And, as we shall see, ﬁnding a random direction whose
expected value corresponds to the gradient is rather simple even though we do
not know the underlying distribution D.

The advantage of SGD, in the context of convex learning problems, over the
regularized risk minimization learning rule is that SGD is an eﬃcient algorithm
that can be implemented in a few lines of code, yet still enjoys the same sample
complexity as the regularized risk minimization rule. The simplicity of SGD also
allows us to use it in situations when it is not possible to apply methods that
are based on the empirical risk, but this is beyond the scope of this book.

We start this chapter with the basic gradient descent algorithm and analyze its
convergence rate for convex-Lipschitz functions. Next, we introduce the notion of
subgradient and show that gradient descent can be applied for nondiﬀerentiable
functions as well. The core of this chapter is Section 14.3, in which we describe

the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm, along with several useful variants.
We show that SGD enjoys an expected convergence rate similar to the rate
of gradient descent. Finally, we turn to the applicability of SGD to learning
problems.

14.1

Gradient Descent

Before we describe the stochastic gradient descent method, we would like to
describe the standard gradient descent approach for minimizing a diﬀerentiable
convex function f (w).

The gradient of a diﬀerentiable function f : Rd → R at w, denoted ∇f (w),
is the vector of partial derivatives of f , namely, ∇f (w) =
.
Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm. We start with an initial value of w
(say, w(1) = 0). Then, at each iteration, we take a step in the direction of the
negative of the gradient at the current point. That is, the update step is

(cid:16) ∂f (w)

∂w[1] , . . . , ∂f (w)

∂w[d]

(cid:17)

w(t+1) = w(t) − η∇f (w(t)),

(14.1)

where η > 0 is a parameter to be discussed later. Intuitively, since the gradi-
ent points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of f around w(t),
the algorithm makes a small step in the opposite direction, thus decreasing the
value of the function. Eventually, after T iterations, the algorithm outputs the
averaged vector, ¯w = 1
t=1 w(t). The output could also be the last vector,
T
w(T ), or the best performing vector, argmint∈[T ] f (w(t)), but taking the average
turns out to be rather useful, especially when we generalize gradient descent to
nondiﬀerentiable functions and to the stochastic case.

(cid:80)T

Another way to motivate gradient descent is by relying on Taylor approxima-
tion. The gradient of f at w yields the ﬁrst order Taylor approximation of f
around w by f (u) ≈ f (w) + (cid:104)u − w,∇f (w)(cid:105). When f is convex, this approxi-
mation lower bounds f , that is,

f (u) ≥ f (w) + (cid:104)u − w,∇f (w)(cid:105).

Therefore, for w close to w(t) we have that f (w) ≈ f (w(t))+(cid:104)w−w(t),∇f (w(t))(cid:105).
Hence we can minimize the approximation of f (w). However, the approximation
might become loose for w, which is far away from w(t). Therefore, we would like
to minimize jointly the distance between w and w(t) and the approximation of
f around w(t). If the parameter η controls the tradeoﬀ between the two terms,
we obtain the update rule

w(t+1) = argmin

(cid:16)

f (w(t)) + (cid:104)w − w(t),∇f (w(t))(cid:105)(cid:17)

.

Solving the preceding by taking the derivative with respect to w and comparing
it to zero yields the same update rule as in Equation (14.1).

Analysis of GD for Convex-Lipschitz Functions

To analyze the convergence rate of the GD algorithm, we limit ourselves to
the case of convex-Lipschitz functions (as we have seen, many problems lend
themselves easily to this setting). Let w(cid:63) be any vector and let B be an upper
bound on (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107). It is convenient to think of w(cid:63) as the minimizer of f (w), but
the analysis that follows holds for every w(cid:63).

We would like to obtain an upper bound on the suboptimality of our solution
t=1 w(t). From the

with respect to w(cid:63), namely, f ( ¯w) − f (w(cid:63)), where ¯w = 1

Stochastic Gradient Descent

Lemma 14.1 applies to the GD algorithm with vt = ∇f (w(t)). As we will
show later in Lemma 14.7, if f is ρ-Lipschitz, then (cid:107)∇f (w(t))(cid:107) ≤ ρ. We therefore
satisfy the lemma’s conditions and achieve the following corollary:
corollary 14.2 Let f be a convex, ρ-Lipschitz function, and let w(cid:63) ∈ argmin{w:(cid:107)w(cid:107)≤B} f (w).
If we run the GD algorithm on f for T steps with η =
vector ¯w satisﬁes

ρ2 T , then the output

(cid:113) B2

f ( ¯w) − f (w(cid:63)) ≤ B ρ√

Furthermore, for every  > 0, to achieve f ( ¯w)− f (w(cid:63)) ≤ , it suﬃces to run the
GD algorithm for a number of iterations that satisﬁes

alize the discussion beyond diﬀerentiable functions. We will show that the GD
algorithm can be applied to nondiﬀerentiable functions by using a so-called sub-
gradient of f (w) at w(t), instead of the gradient.

To motivate the deﬁnition of subgradients, recall that for a convex function f ,

the gradient at w deﬁnes the slope of a tangent that lies below f , that is,

∀u,

f (u) ≥ f (w) + (cid:104)u − w,∇f (w)(cid:105).

(14.7)

An illustration is given on the left-hand side of Figure 14.2.

The existence of a tangent that lies below f is an important property of convex

functions, which is in fact an alternative characterization of convexity.
lemma 14.3 Let S be an open convex set. A function f : S → R is convex iﬀ
for every w ∈ S there exists v such that

∀u ∈ S,

f (u) ≥ f (w) + (cid:104)u − w, v(cid:105).

(14.8)

The proof of this lemma can be found in many convex analysis textbooks (e.g.,
(Borwein & Lewis 2006)). The preceding inequality leads us to the deﬁnition of
subgradients.

definition 14.4 (Subgradients) A vector v that satisﬁes Equation (14.8) is
called a subgradient of f at w. The set of subgradients of f at w is called the
diﬀerential set and denoted ∂f (w).

An illustration of subgradients is given on the right-hand side of Figure 14.2.
For scalar functions, a subgradient of a convex function f at w is a slope of a
line that touches f at w and is not above f elsewhere.

14.2.1

Calculating Subgradients

How do we construct subgradients of a given convex function? If a function is
diﬀerentiable at a point w, then the diﬀerential set is trivial, as the following
claim shows.

claim 14.5
the gradient of f at w, ∇f (w).

If f is diﬀerentiable at w then ∂f (w) contains a single element –

Example 14.1 (The Diﬀerential Set of the Absolute Function) Consider the
absolute value function f (x) = |x|. Using Claim 14.5, we can easily construct
the diﬀerential set for the diﬀerentiable parts of f , and the only point that
requires special attention is x0 = 0. At that point, it is easy to verify that the
subdiﬀerential is the set of all numbers between −1 and 1. Hence:



∂f (x) =

{1}
{−1}
[−1, 1]

if x > 0

if x < 0

if x = 0

For many practical uses, we do not need to calculate the whole set of subgra-
dients at a given point, as one member of this set would suﬃce. The following
claim shows how to construct a sub-gradient for pointwise maximum functions.

claim 14.6 Let g(w) = maxi∈[r] gi(w) for r convex diﬀerentiable functions
g1, . . . , gr. Given some w, let j ∈ argmaxi gi(w). Then ∇gj(w) ∈ ∂g(w).
Proof Since gj is convex we have that for all u

gj(u) ≥ gj(w) + (cid:104)u − w,∇gj(w)(cid:105).

Since g(w) = gj(w) and g(u) ≥ gj(u) we obtain that

g(u) ≥ g(w) + (cid:104)u − w,∇gj(w)(cid:105),

which concludes our proof.

Stochastic Gradient Descent

Example 14.2 (A Subgradient of the Hinge Loss) Recall the hinge loss function
from Section 12.3, f (w) = max{0, 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)} for some vector x and scalar y.
To calculate a subgradient of the hinge loss at some w we rely on the preceding
claim and obtain that the vector v deﬁned in the following is a subgradient of
the hinge loss at w:

(cid:40)

v =

if 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) ≤ 0
0
−yx if 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) > 0

14.2.2

Subgradients of Lipschitz Functions
Recall that a function f : A → R is ρ-Lipschitz if for all u, v ∈ A

|f (u) − f (v)| ≤ ρ(cid:107)u − v(cid:107).

The following lemma gives an equivalent deﬁnition using norms of subgradients.
lemma 14.7 Let A be a convex open set and let f : A → R be a convex function.
Then, f is ρ-Lipschitz over A iﬀ for all w ∈ A and v ∈ ∂f (w) we have that
(cid:107)v(cid:107) ≤ ρ.
Proof Assume that for all v ∈ ∂f (w) we have that (cid:107)v(cid:107) ≤ ρ. Since v ∈ ∂f (w)
we have

f (w) − f (u) ≤ (cid:104)v, w − u(cid:105).

Bounding the right-hand side using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality we obtain

f (w) − f (u) ≤ (cid:104)v, w − u(cid:105) ≤ (cid:107)v(cid:107)(cid:107)w − u(cid:107) ≤ ρ(cid:107)w − u(cid:107).

An analogous argument can show that f (u) − f (w) ≤ ρ(cid:107)w − u(cid:107). Hence f is
ρ-Lipschitz.
Now assume that f is ρ-Lipschitz. Choose some w ∈ A, v ∈ ∂f (w). Since A
is open, there exists  > 0 such that u = w + v/(cid:107)v(cid:107) belongs to A. Therefore,
(cid:104)u − w, v(cid:105) = (cid:107)v(cid:107) and (cid:107)u − w(cid:107) = . From the deﬁnition of the subgradient,

f (u) − f (w) ≥ (cid:104)v, u − w(cid:105) = (cid:107)v(cid:107).

On the other hand, from the Lipschitzness of f we have
ρ  = ρ(cid:107)u − w(cid:107) ≥ f (u) − f (w).

Combining the two inequalities we conclude that (cid:107)v(cid:107) ≤ ρ.

14.2.3

Subgradient Descent

The gradient descent algorithm can be generalized to nondiﬀerentiable functions
by using a subgradient of f (w) at w(t), instead of the gradient. The analysis of
the convergence rate remains unchanged: Simply note that Equation (14.3) is
true for subgradients as well.

14.3

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

In stochastic gradient descent we do not require the update direction to be based
exactly on the gradient. Instead, we allow the direction to be a random vector
and only require that its expected value at each iteration will equal the gradient
direction. Or, more generally, we require that the expected value of the random
vector will be a subgradient of the function at the current vector.

function.

14.3.1

Analysis of SGD for Convex-Lipschitz-Bounded Functions

Recall the bound we achieved for the GD algorithm in Corollary 14.2. For the
stochastic case, in which only the expectation of vt is in ∂f (w(t)), we cannot
directly apply Equation (14.3). However, since the expected value of vt is a

192

Stochastic Gradient Descent

subgradient of f at w(t), we can still derive a similar bound on the expected
output of stochastic gradient descent. This is formalized in the following theorem.
theorem 14.8 Let B, ρ > 0. Let f be a convex function and let w(cid:63) ∈ argminw:(cid:107)w(cid:107)≤B f (w).
Assume that SGD is run for T iterations with η =
all t, (cid:107)vt(cid:107) ≤ ρ with probability 1. Then,

ρ2 T . Assume also that for

(cid:113) B2

Therefore, for any  > 0, to achieve E[f ( ¯w)] − f (w(cid:63)) ≤ , it suﬃces to run the
SGD algorithm for a number of iterations that satisﬁes

Summing over t, dividing by T , and using the linearity of expectation, we get

14.4

Variants

In this section we describe several variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent.

14.4.1

Adding a Projection Step

In the previous analyses of the GD and SGD algorithms, we required that the
norm of w(cid:63) will be at most B, which is equivalent to requiring that w(cid:63) is in the
set H = {w : (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B}. In terms of learning, this means restricting ourselves to
a B-bounded hypothesis class. Yet any step we take in the opposite direction of
the gradient (or its expected direction) might result in stepping out of this bound,
and there is even no guarantee that ¯w satisﬁes it. We show in the following how
to overcome this problem while maintaining the same convergence rate.

The basic idea is to add a projection step; namely, we will now have a two-step
update rule, where we ﬁrst subtract a subgradient from the current value of w
and then project the resulting vector onto H. Formally,

2 ) = w(t) − ηvt

2 )(cid:107)

1.. w(t+ 1
2.. w(t+1) = argminw∈H (cid:107)w − w(t+ 1
The projection step replaces the current value of w by the vector in H closest
to it.

Clearly, the projection step guarantees that w(t) ∈ H for all t. Since H is
convex this also implies that ¯w ∈ H as required. We next show that the analysis
of SGD with projections remains the same. This is based on the following lemma.

lemma 14.9 (Projection Lemma) Let H be a closed convex set and let v be the
projection of w onto H, namely,

v = argmin

x∈H

(cid:107)x − w(cid:107)2.

194

Stochastic Gradient Descent

Then, for every u ∈ H,

(cid:107)w − u(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)v − u(cid:107)2 ≥ 0.

Proof By the convexity of H, for every α ∈ (0, 1) we have that v+α(u−v) ∈ H.
Therefore, from the optimality of v we obtain
(cid:107)v − w(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)v + α(u − v) − w(cid:107)2

= (cid:107)v − w(cid:107)2 + 2α(cid:104)v − w, u − v(cid:105) + α2(cid:107)u − v(cid:107)2.

Rearranging, we obtain

2(cid:104)v − w, u − v(cid:105) ≥ −α(cid:107)u − v(cid:107)2.

Taking the limit α → 0 we get that

(cid:104)v − w, u − v(cid:105) ≥ 0.

Therefore,

(cid:107)w − u(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)w − v + v − u(cid:107)2

= (cid:107)w − v(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)v − u(cid:107)2 + 2(cid:104)v − w, u − v(cid:105)
≥ (cid:107)v − u(cid:107)2.

Equipped with the preceding lemma, we can easily adapt the analysis of SGD
to the case in which we add projection steps on a closed and convex set. Simply
note that for every t,

(cid:107)w(t+1) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)w(t) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2
= (cid:107)w(t+1) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)w(t+ 1
≤ (cid:107)w(t+ 1

2 ) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)w(t) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2.

2 ) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)w(t+ 1

2 ) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)w(t) − w(cid:63)(cid:107)2

Therefore, Lemma 14.1 holds when we add projection steps and hence the rest
of the analysis follows directly.

14.4.2

Variable Step Size

Another variant of SGD is decreasing the step size as a function of t. That is,
rather than updating with a constant η, we use ηt. For instance, we can set
√
ηt = B
and achieve a bound similar to Theorem 14.8. The idea is that when
ρ
we are closer to the minimum of the function, we take our steps more carefully,
so as not to “overshoot” the minimum.

14.4.3

Other Averaging Techniques

(cid:80)T

We have set the output vector to be ¯w = 1
t=1 w(t). There are alternative
approaches such as outputting w(t) for some random t ∈ [t], or outputting the
T
average of w(t) over the last αT iterations, for some α ∈ (0, 1). One can also take
a weighted average of the last few iterates. These more sophisticated averaging
schemes can improve the convergence speed in some situations, such as in the
case of strongly convex functions deﬁned in the following.

14.4.4

Strongly Convex Functions*

In this section we show a variant of SGD that enjoys a faster convergence rate for
problems in which the objective function is strongly convex (see Deﬁnition 13.4
of strong convexity in the previous chapter). We rely on the following claim,
which generalizes Lemma 13.5.

Learning with SGD

We have so far introduced and analyzed the SGD algorithm for general convex
functions. Now we shall consider its applicability to learning tasks.

14.5.1

SGD for Risk Minimization

Recall that in learning we face the problem of minimizing the risk function

LD(w) = E

z∼D[(cid:96)(w, z)].

We have seen the method of empirical risk minimization, where we minimize the
empirical risk, LS(w), as an estimate to minimizing LD(w). SGD allows us to
take a diﬀerent approach and minimize LD(w) directly. Since we do not know
D, we cannot simply calculate ∇LD(w(t)) and minimize it with the GD method.
With SGD, however, all we need is to ﬁnd an unbiased estimate of the gradient of

14.5 Learning with SGD

197

LD(w), that is, a random vector whose conditional expected value is ∇LD(w(t)).
We shall now see how such an estimate can be easily constructed.

For simplicity, let us ﬁrst consider the case of diﬀerentiable loss functions.
Hence the risk function LD is also diﬀerentiable. The construction of the random
vector vt will be as follows: First, sample z ∼ D. Then, deﬁne vt to be the
gradient of the function (cid:96)(w, z) with respect to w, at the point w(t). Then, by
the linearity of the gradient we have

E[vt|w(t)] = E

z∼D[∇(cid:96)(w(t), z)] = ∇ E

z∼D[(cid:96)(w(t), z)] = ∇LD(w(t)).

(14.13)

The gradient of the loss function (cid:96)(w, z) at w(t) is therefore an unbiased estimate
of the gradient of the risk function LD(w(t)) and is easily constructed by sampling
a single fresh example z ∼ D at each iteration t.

The same argument holds for nondiﬀerentiable loss functions. We simply let

vt be a subgradient of (cid:96)(w, z) at w(t). Then, for every u we have

(cid:96)(u, z) − (cid:96)(w(t), z) ≥ (cid:104)u − w(t), vt(cid:105).

Taking expectation on both sides with respect to z ∼ D and conditioned on the
value of w(t) we obtain

LD(u) − LD(w(t)) = E[(cid:96)(u, z) − (cid:96)(w(t), z)|w(t)]

≥ E[(cid:104)u − w(t), vt(cid:105)|w(t)]
= (cid:104)u − w(t), E[vt|w(t)](cid:105).
It follows that E[vt|w(t)] is a subgradient of LD(w) at w(t).

To summarize, the stochastic gradient descent framework for minimizing the

risk is as follows.

It is interesting to note that the required sample complexity is of the same order
of magnitude as the sample complexity guarantee we derived for regularized loss
minimization. In fact, the sample complexity of SGD is even better than what
we have derived for regularized loss minimization by a factor of 8.

14.5.2

Analyzing SGD for Convex-Smooth Learning Problems

In the previous chapter we saw that the regularized loss minimization rule also
learns the class of convex-smooth-bounded learning problems. We now show that
the SGD algorithm can be also used for such problems.
theorem 14.13 Assume that for all z, the loss function (cid:96)(·, z) is convex, β-
smooth, and nonnegative. Then, if we run the SGD algorithm for minimizing
LD(w) we have that for every w(cid:63),

Proof Recall that if a function is β-smooth and nonnegative then it is self-
bounded:

(cid:107)∇f (w)(cid:107)2 ≤ 2βf (w).

To analyze SGD for convex-smooth problems, let us deﬁne z1, . . . , zT the random
samples of the SGD algorithm, let ft(·) = (cid:96)(·, zt), and note that vt = ∇ft(w(t)).
For all t, ft is a convex function and therefore ft(w(t))−ft(w(cid:63)) ≤ (cid:104)vt, w(t)−w(cid:63)(cid:105).
Summing over t and using Lemma 14.1 we obtain

SGD for Regularized Loss Minimization

We have shown that SGD enjoys the same worst-case sample complexity bound
as regularized loss minimization. However, on some distributions, regularized loss
minimization may yield a better solution. Therefore, in some cases we may want
to solve the optimization problem associated with regularized loss minimization,
namely,1

Since we are dealing with convex learning problems in which the loss function is
convex, the preceding problem is also a convex optimization problem that can
be solved using SGD as well, as we shall see in this section.

2(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 + LS(w). Note that f is a λ-strongly convex function;
therefore, we can apply the SGD variant given in Section 14.4.4 (with H = Rd).
To apply this algorithm, we only need to ﬁnd a way to construct an unbiased
estimate of a subgradient of f at w(t). This is easily done by noting that if
we pick z uniformly at random from S, and choose vt ∈ ∂(cid:96)(w(t), z) then the
expected value of λw(t) + vt is a subgradient of f at w(t).

To analyze the resulting algorithm, we ﬁrst rewrite the update rule (assuming

(cid:107)λw(t) + vt(cid:107) ≤ 2ρ.

Theorem 14.11 therefore tells us that after performing T iterations we have that

Summary

We have introduced the Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent algo-
rithms, along with several of their variants. We have analyzed their convergence
rate and calculated the number of iterations that would guarantee an expected
objective of at most  plus the optimal objective. Most importantly, we have
shown that by using SGD we can directly minimize the risk function. We do
so by sampling a point i.i.d from D and using a subgradient of the loss of the
current hypothesis w(t) at this point as an unbiased estimate of the gradient (or
a subgradient) of the risk function. This implies that a bound on the number of
iterations also yields a sample complexity bound. Finally, we have also shown
how to apply the SGD method to the problem of regularized risk minimization.
In future chapters we show how this yields extremely simple solvers to some
optimization problems associated with regularized risk minimization.

Bibliographic Remarks

SGD dates back to Robbins & Monro (1951). It is especially eﬀective in large
scale machine learning problems. See, for example, (Murata 1998, Le Cun 2004,
Zhang 2004, Bottou & Bousquet 2008, Shalev-Shwartz, Singer & Srebro 2007,
Shalev-Shwartz & Srebro 2008). In the optimization community it was studied

in the context of stochastic optimization. See, for example, (Nemirovski & Yudin
1978, Nesterov & Nesterov 2004, Nesterov 2005, Nemirovski, Juditsky, Lan &
Shapiro 2009, Shapiro, Dentcheva & Ruszczy´nski 2009).

The bound we have derived for strongly convex function is due to Hazan,
Agarwal & Kale (2007). As mentioned previously, improved bounds have been
obtained in Rakhlin et al. (2012).

15 Support Vector Machines

In this chapter and the next we discuss a very useful machine learning tool: the
support vector machine paradigm (SVM) for learning linear predictors in high
dimensional feature spaces. The high dimensionality of the feature space raises
both sample complexity and computational complexity challenges.

The SVM algorithmic paradigm tackles the sample complexity challenge by
searching for “large margin” separators. Roughly speaking, a halfspace separates
a training set with a large margin if all the examples are not only on the correct
side of the separating hyperplane but also far away from it. Restricting the
algorithm to output a large margin separator can yield a small sample complexity
even if the dimensionality of the feature space is high (and even inﬁnite). We
introduce the concept of margin and relate it to the regularized loss minimization
paradigm as well as to the convergence rate of the Perceptron algorithm.

In the next chapter we will tackle the computational complexity challenge

using the idea of kernels.

15.1

Margin and Hard-SVM

Let S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym) be a training set of examples, where each xi ∈ Rd
and yi ∈ {±1}. We say that this training set is linearly separable, if there exists
a halfspace, (w, b), such that yi = sign((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) for all i. Alternatively, this
condition can be rewritten as

∀i ∈ [m], yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) > 0.

All halfspaces (w, b) that satisfy this condition are ERM hypotheses (their 0-1
error is zero, which is the minimum possible error). For any separable training
sample, there are many ERM halfspaces. Which one of them should the learner
pick?

Consider, for example, the training set described in the picture that follows.

15.1 Margin and Hard-SVM

203

x

While both the dashed-black and solid-green hyperplanes separate the four ex-
amples, our intuition would probably lead us to prefer the black hyperplane over
the green one. One way to formalize this intuition is using the concept of margin.
The margin of a hyperplane with respect to a training set is deﬁned to be the
minimal distance between a point in the training set and the hyperplane. If a
hyperplane has a large margin, then it will still separate the training set even if
we slightly perturb each instance.

We will see later on that the true error of a halfspace can be bounded in terms
of the margin it has over the training sample (the larger the margin, the smaller
the error), regardless of the Euclidean dimension in which this halfspace resides.
Hard-SVM is the learning rule in which we return an ERM hyperplane that
separates the training set with the largest possible margin. To deﬁne Hard-SVM
formally, we ﬁrst express the distance between a point x to a hyperplane using
the parameters deﬁning the halfspace.

claim 15.1 The distance between a point x and the hyperplane deﬁned by
(w, b) where (cid:107)w(cid:107) = 1 is |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b|.

Proof The distance between a point x and the hyperplane is deﬁned as

min{(cid:107)x − v(cid:107) : (cid:104)w, v(cid:105) + b = 0}.

Taking v = x − ((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b)w we have that

(cid:104)w, v(cid:105) + b = (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) − ((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b)(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 + b = 0,

and

(cid:107)x − v(cid:107) = |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b|(cid:107)w(cid:107) = |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b|.

Hence, the distance is at most |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b|. Next, take any other point u on the
hyperplane, thus (cid:104)w, u(cid:105) + b = 0. We have

(cid:107)x − u(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)x − v + v − u(cid:107)2

= (cid:107)x − v(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)v − u(cid:107)2 + 2(cid:104)x − v, v − u(cid:105)
≥ (cid:107)x − v(cid:107)2 + 2(cid:104)x − v, v − u(cid:105)
= (cid:107)x − v(cid:107)2 + 2((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b)(cid:104)w, v − u(cid:105)
= (cid:107)x − v(cid:107)2,

where the last equality is because (cid:104)w, v(cid:105) = (cid:104)w, u(cid:105) = −b. Hence, the distance

204

Support Vector Machines

between x and u is at least the distance between x and v, which concludes our
proof.

On the basis of the preceding claim, the closest point in the training set to the
separating hyperplane is mini∈[m] |(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b|. Therefore, the Hard-SVM rule is

argmax

(w,b):(cid:107)w(cid:107)=1

min
i∈[m]

|(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b|

s.t. ∀i, yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) > 0.

Whenever there is a solution to the preceding problem (i.e., we are in the sepa-
rable case), we can write an equivalent problem as follows (see Exercise 1):

argmax

(w,b):(cid:107)w(cid:107)=1

min
i∈[m]

yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b).

(15.1)

Next, we give another equivalent formulation of the Hard-SVM rule as a quadratic
optimization problem.1

Hard-SVM

input: (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)
solve:

(w0, b0) = argmin

(w,b)

(15.2)

output: ˆw = w0(cid:107)w0(cid:107) , ˆb = b0(cid:107)w0(cid:107)

The lemma that follows shows that the output of hard-SVM is indeed the
separating hyperplane with the largest margin. Intuitively, hard-SVM searches
for w of minimal norm among all the vectors that separate the data and for
which |(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b| ≥ 1 for all i. In other words, we enforce the margin to be 1,
but now the units in which we measure the margin scale with the norm of w.
Therefore, ﬁnding the largest margin halfspace boils down to ﬁnding w whose
norm is minimal. Formally:

lemma 15.2 The output of Hard-SVM is a solution of Equation (15.1).

Proof Let (w(cid:63), b(cid:63)) be a solution of Equation (15.1) and deﬁne the margin
achieved by (w(cid:63), b(cid:63)) to be γ(cid:63) = mini∈[m] yi((cid:104)w(cid:63), xi(cid:105) + b(cid:63)). Therefore, for all
i we have

yi((cid:104)w(cid:63), xi(cid:105) + b(cid:63)) ≥ γ(cid:63)

or equivalently

yi((cid:104) w(cid:63)

γ(cid:63) , xi(cid:105) + b(cid:63)

γ(cid:63) ) ≥ 1.

Hence, the pair ( w(cid:63)

γ(cid:63) , b(cid:63)

γ(cid:63) ) satisﬁes the conditions of the quadratic optimization

1 A quadratic optimization problem is an optimization problem in which the objective is a

convex quadratic function and the constraints are linear inequalities.

15.1 Margin and Hard-SVM

problem given in Equation (15.2). Therefore, (cid:107)w0(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107) w(cid:63)
for all i,

γ(cid:63) (cid:107) = 1

γ(cid:63) . It follows that

yi((cid:104) ˆw, xi(cid:105) + ˆb) =

1

(cid:107)w0(cid:107) yi((cid:104)w0, xi(cid:105) + b0) ≥ 1

(cid:107)w0(cid:107) ≥ γ(cid:63).

Since (cid:107) ˆw(cid:107) = 1 we obtain that ( ˆw, ˆb) is an optimal solution of Equation (15.1).

15.1.1

The Homogenous Case

15.1.2

It is often more convenient to consider homogenous halfspaces, namely, halfspaces
that pass through the origin and are thus deﬁned by sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)), where the bias
term b is set to be zero. Hard-SVM for homogenous halfspaces amounts to solving

(cid:107)w(cid:107)2

s.t. ∀i, yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) ≥ 1.

min

w

(15.3)

As we discussed in Chapter 9, we can reduce the problem of learning nonhomogenous

halfspaces to the problem of learning homogenous halfspaces by adding one more
feature to each instance of xi, thus increasing the dimension to d + 1.

Note, however, that the optimization problem given in Equation (15.2) does
not regularize the bias term b, while if we learn a homogenous halfspace in Rd+1
using Equation (15.3) then we regularize the bias term (i.e., the d + 1 component
of the weight vector) as well. However, regularizing b usually does not make a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the sample complexity.

The Sample Complexity of Hard-SVM
Recall that the VC-dimension of halfspaces in Rd is d + 1. It follows that the
sample complexity of learning halfspaces grows with the dimensionality of the
problem. Furthermore, the fundamental theorem of learning tells us that if the
number of examples is signiﬁcantly smaller than d/ then no algorithm can learn
an -accurate halfspace. This is problematic when d is very large.

To overcome this problem, we will make an additional assumption on the
underlying data distribution. In particular, we will deﬁne a “separability with
margin γ” assumption and will show that if the data is separable with margin
γ then the sample complexity is bounded from above by a function of 1/γ2. It
follows that even if the dimensionality is very large (or even inﬁnite), as long as
the data adheres to the separability with margin assumption we can still have a
small sample complexity. There is no contradiction to the lower bound given in
the fundamental theorem of learning because we are now making an additional
assumption on the underlying data distribution.

Before we formally deﬁne the separability with margin assumption, there is a

scaling issue we need to resolve. Suppose that a training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)
is separable with a margin γ, namely, the maximal objective value of Equa-
tion (15.1) is at least γ. Then, for any positive scalar α > 0, the training set

206

Support Vector Machines

S(cid:48) = (αx1, y1), . . . , (αxm, ym) is separable with a margin of αγ. That is, a sim-
ple scaling of the data can make it separable with an arbitrarily large margin. It
follows that in order to give a meaningful deﬁnition of margin we must take into
account the scale of the examples as well. One way to formalize this is using the
deﬁnition that follows.
definition 15.3 Let D be a distribution over Rd × {±1}. We say that D is
separable with a (γ, ρ)-margin if there exists (w(cid:63), b(cid:63)) such that (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107) = 1 and
such that with probability 1 over the choice of (x, y) ∼ D we have that y((cid:104)w(cid:63), x(cid:105)+
b(cid:63)) ≥ γ and (cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ ρ. Similarly, we say that D is separable with a (γ, ρ)-margin
using a homogenous halfspace if the preceding holds with a halfspace of the form
(w(cid:63), 0).

In the advanced part of the book (Chapter 26), we will prove that the sample
complexity of Hard-SVM depends on (ρ/γ)2 and is independent of the dimension
d. In particular, Theorem 26.13 in Section 26.3 states the following:
theorem 15.4 Let D be a distribution over Rd×{±1} that satisﬁes the (γ, ρ)-
separability with margin assumption using a homogenous halfspace. Then, with
probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of a training set of size m, the 0-1
error of the output of Hard-SVM is at most

Remark 15.1 (Margin and the Perceptron)
In Section 9.1.2 we have described
and analyzed the Perceptron algorithm for ﬁnding an ERM hypothesis with
respect to the class of halfspaces. In particular, in Theorem 9.1 we upper bounded
the number of updates the Perceptron might make on a given training set. It
can be shown (see Exercise 2) that the upper bound is exactly (ρ/γ)2, where ρ
is the radius of examples and γ is the margin.

15.2

Soft-SVM and Norm Regularization

The Hard-SVM formulation assumes that the training set is linearly separable,
which is a rather strong assumption. Soft-SVM can be viewed as a relaxation of
the Hard-SVM rule that can be applied even if the training set is not linearly
separable.
The optimization problem in Equation (15.2) enforces the hard constraints
yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) ≥ 1 for all i. A natural relaxation is to allow the constraint to be
violated for some of the examples in the training set. This can be modeled by
introducing nonnegative slack variables, ξ1, . . . , ξm, and replacing each constraint
yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) ≥ 1 by the constraint yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) ≥ 1− ξi. That is, ξi measures
by how much the constraint yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105)+b) ≥ 1 is being violated. Soft-SVM jointly
minimizes the norm of w (corresponding to the margin) and the average of ξi
(corresponding to the violations of the constraints). The tradeoﬀ between the two

15.2 Soft-SVM and Norm Regularization

207

terms is controlled by a parameter λ. This leads to the Soft-SVM optimization
problem:

We can rewrite Equation (15.4) as a regularized loss minimization problem.

Recall the deﬁnition of the hinge loss:

(cid:96)hinge((w, b), (x, y)) = max{0, 1 − y((cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b)}.

Given (w, b) and a training set S, the averaged hinge loss on S is denoted by
Lhinge

((w, b)). Now, consider the regularized loss minimization problem:

(15.5)

claim 15.5 Equation (15.4) and Equation (15.5) are equivalent.

Proof Fix some w, b and consider the minimization over ξ in Equation (15.4).
Fix some i. Since ξi must be nonnegative, the best assignment to ξi would be 0
if yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) ≥ 1 and would be 1 − yi((cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) + b) otherwise. In other words,
ξi = (cid:96)hinge((w, b), (xi, yi)) for all i, and the claim follows.

We therefore see that Soft-SVM falls into the paradigm of regularized loss
minimization that we studied in the previous chapter. A Soft-SVM algorithm,
that is, a solution for Equation (15.5), has a bias toward low norm separators.
The objective function that we aim to minimize in Equation (15.5) penalizes not
only for training errors but also for large norm.

It is often more convenient to consider Soft-SVM for learning a homogenous
halfspace, where the bias term b is set to be zero, which yields the following
optimization problem:

15.2.1

The Sample Complexity of Soft-SVM

We now analyze the sample complexity of Soft-SVM for the case of homogenous
halfspaces (namely, the output of Equation (15.6)). In Corollary 13.8 we derived
a generalization bound for the regularized loss minimization framework assuming
that the loss function is convex and Lipschitz. We have already shown that the
hinge loss is convex so it is only left to analyze the Lipschitzness of the hinge
loss.
claim 15.6 Let f (w) = max{0, 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)}. Then, f is (cid:107)x(cid:107)-Lipschitz.

It is easy to verify that any subgradient of f at w is of the form αx where

Proof
|α| ≤ 1. The claim now follows from Lemma 14.7.

Corollary 13.8 therefore yields the following:

corollary 15.7 Let D be a distribution over X × {0, 1}, where X = {x :
(cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ ρ}. Consider running Soft-SVM (Equation (15.6)) on a training set S ∼
Dm and let A(S) be the solution of Soft-SVM. Then, for every u,

Furthermore, since the hinge loss upper bounds the 0−1 loss we also have

We therefore see that we can control the sample complexity of learning a half-
space as a function of the norm of that halfspace, independently of the Euclidean
dimension of the space over which the halfspace is deﬁned. This becomes highly
signiﬁcant when we learn via embeddings into high dimensional feature spaces,
as we will consider in the next chapter.
Remark 15.2 The condition that X will contain vectors with a bounded norm
follows from the requirement that the loss function will be Lipschitz. This is
not just a technicality. As we discussed before, separation with large margin
is meaningless without imposing a restriction on the scale of the instances. In-
deed, without a constraint on the scale, we can always enlarge the margin by
multiplying all instances by a large scalar.

15.2.2

Margin and Norm-Based Bounds versus Dimension

The bounds we have derived for Hard-SVM and Soft-SVM do not depend on the
dimension of the instance space. Instead, the bounds depend on the norm of the

15.2 Soft-SVM and Norm Regularization

209

examples, ρ, the norm of the halfspace B (or equivalently the margin parameter
γ) and, in the nonseparable case, the bounds also depend on the minimum hinge
loss of all halfspaces of norm ≤ B. In contrast, the VC-dimension of the class of
homogenous halfspaces is d, which implies that the error of an ERM hypothesis

decreases as (cid:112)d/m does. We now give an example in which ρ2B2 (cid:28) d; hence

the bound given in Corollary 15.7 is much better than the VC bound.

Consider the problem of learning to classify a short text document according
to its topic, say, whether the document is about sports or not. We ﬁrst need to
represent documents as vectors. One simple yet eﬀective way is to use a bag-
of-words representation. That is, we deﬁne a dictionary of words and set the
dimension d to be the number of words in the dictionary. Given a document,
we represent it as a vector x ∈ {0, 1}d, where xi = 1 if the i’th word in the
dictionary appears in the document and xi = 0 otherwise. Therefore, for this
problem, the value of ρ2 will be the maximal number of distinct words in a given
document.

A halfspace for this problem assigns weights to words. It is natural to assume
that by assigning positive and negative weights to a few dozen words we will
be able to determine whether a given document is about sports or not with
reasonable accuracy. Therefore, for this problem, the value of B2 can be set to
be less than 100. Overall, it is reasonable to say that the value of B2ρ2 is smaller
than 10,000.

On the other hand, a typical size of a dictionary is much larger than 10,000.
For example, there are more than 100,000 distinct words in English. We have
therefore shown a problem in which there can be an order of magnitude diﬀerence
between learning a halfspace with the SVM rule and learning a halfspace using
the vanilla ERM rule.

Of course, it is possible to construct problems in which the SVM bound will
be worse than the VC bound. When we use SVM, we in fact introduce another
form of inductive bias – we prefer large margin halfspaces. While this induc-
tive bias can signiﬁcantly decrease our estimation error, it can also enlarge the
approximation error.

15.2.3

The Ramp Loss*

The margin-based bounds we have derived in Corollary 15.7 rely on the fact that
we minimize the hinge loss. As we have shown in the previous subsection, the

term (cid:112)ρ2B2/m can be much smaller than the corresponding term in the VC
bound,(cid:112)d/m. However, the approximation error in Corollary 15.7 is measured

with respect to the hinge loss while the approximation error in VC bounds is
measured with respect to the 0−1 loss. Since the hinge loss upper bounds the
0−1 loss, the approximation error with respect to the 0−1 loss will never exceed
that of the hinge loss.

(cid:112)ρ2B2/m for the 0−1 loss. This follows from the fact that the 0−1 loss is scale

It is not possible to derive bounds that involve the estimation error term

210

Support Vector Machines

insensitive, and therefore there is no meaning to the norm of w or its margin
when we measure error with the 0−1 loss. However, it is possible to deﬁne a loss
function that on one hand it is scale sensitive and thus enjoys the estimation

error(cid:112)ρ2B2/m while on the other hand it is more similar to the 0−1 loss. One

option is the ramp loss, deﬁned as

(cid:96)ramp(w, (x, y)) = min{1, (cid:96)hinge(w, (x, y))} = min{1 , max{0, 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)}}.
The ramp loss penalizes mistakes in the same way as the 0−1 loss and does not
penalize examples that are separated with margin. The diﬀerence between the
ramp loss and the 0−1 loss is only with respect to examples that are correctly
classiﬁed but not with a signiﬁcant margin. Generalization bounds for the ramp
loss are given in the advanced part of this book (see Appendix 26.3).

The reason SVM relies on the hinge loss and not on the ramp loss is that
the hinge loss is convex and, therefore, from the computational point of view,
minimizing the hinge loss can be performed eﬃciently. In contrast, the problem
of minimizing the ramp loss is computationally intractable.

15.3

Optimality Conditions and “Support Vectors”*

The name “Support Vector Machine” stems from the fact that the solution of
hard-SVM, w0, is supported by (i.e., is in the linear span of) the examples that
are exactly at distance 1/(cid:107)w0(cid:107) from the separating hyperplane. These vectors are
therefore called support vectors. To see this, we rely on Fritz John optimality
conditions.
theorem 15.8 Let w0 be as deﬁned in Equation (15.3) and let I = {i :
|(cid:104)w0, xi(cid:105)| = 1}. Then, there exist coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αm such that

The examples {xi : i ∈ I} are called support vectors.
The proof of this theorem follows by applying the following lemma to Equa-

tion (15.3).

i∈I αi∇gi(w(cid:63)) = 0, where I = {i : gi(w(cid:63)) = 0}.

15.4

Duality*

Historically, many of the properties of SVM have been obtained by considering
the dual of Equation (15.3). Our presentation of SVM does not rely on duality.
For completeness, we present in the following how to derive the dual of Equa-
tion (15.3).

We start by rewriting the problem in an equivalent form as follows. Consider

the function

g(w) =

max

α∈Rm:α≥0

m(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:40)

αi(1 − yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105)) =

(cid:0)(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 + g(w)(cid:1) .

if ∀i, yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) ≥ 1

0
∞ otherwise

.

(15.7)

We can therefore rewrite Equation (15.3) as

min

w

(cid:32)

(cid:32)

m(cid:88)

i=1

m(cid:88)

i=1

Rearranging the preceding we obtain that Equation (15.3) can be rewritten as
the problem

αi(1 − yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105))

(15.8)

Now suppose that we ﬂip the order of min and max in the above equation. This
can only decrease the objective value (see Exercise 4), and we have

(cid:32)

m(cid:88)

αi(1 − yi(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105))

.

The preceding inequality is called weak duality. It turns out that in our case,
strong duality also holds; namely, the inequality holds with equality. Therefore,
the dual problem is

We can simplify the dual problem by noting that once α is ﬁxed, the optimization

thus, at the optimum, the gradient equals zero:

This shows us that the solution must be in the linear span of the examples, a
fact we will use later to derive SVM with kernels. Plugging the preceding into

Note that the dual problem only involves inner products between instances and
does not require direct access to speciﬁc elements within an instance. This prop-
erty is important when implementing SVM with kernels, as we will discuss in
the next chapter.

where vj is a subgradient of the loss function at w(j) on the random example

to be 0 if y(cid:104)w(j), x(cid:105) ≥ 1 and vj = −y x otherwise (see Example 14.2). Denoting

θ(t) = −(cid:80)

j<t vj we obtain the following procedure.

Summary

SVM is an algorithm for learning halfspaces with a certain type of prior knowl-
edge, namely, preference for large margin. Hard-SVM seeks the halfspace that
separates the data perfectly with the largest margin, whereas soft-SVM does
not assume separability of the data and allows the constraints to be violated to
some extent. The sample complexity for both types of SVM is diﬀerent from the
sample complexity of straightforward halfspace learning, as it does not depend
on the dimension of the domain but rather on parameters such as the maximal
norms of x and w.

The importance of dimension-independent sample complexity will be realized
in the next chapter, where we will discuss the embedding of the given domain
into some high dimensional feature space as means for enriching our hypothesis
class. Such a procedure raises computational and sample complexity problems.
The latter is solved by using SVM, whereas the former can be solved by using
SVM with kernels, as we will see in the next chapter.

Bibliographic Remarks

SVMs have been introduced in (Cortes & Vapnik 1995, Boser, Guyon & Vapnik
1992). There are many good books on the theoretical and practical aspects of
SVMs. For example, (Vapnik 1995, Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor 2000, Sch¨olkopf
& Smola 2002, Hsu, Chang & Lin 2003, Steinwart & Christmann 2008). Using
SGD for solving soft-SVM has been proposed in Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2007).

16 Kernel Methods

In the previous chapter we described the SVM paradigm for learning halfspaces
in high dimensional feature spaces. This enables us to enrich the expressive
power of halfspaces by ﬁrst mapping the data into a high dimensional feature
space, and then learning a linear predictor in that space. This is similar to the
AdaBoost algorithm, which learns a composition of a halfspace over base hy-
potheses. While this approach greatly extends the expressiveness of halfspace
predictors, it raises both sample complexity and computational complexity chal-
lenges. In the previous chapter we tackled the sample complexity issue using
the concept of margin. In this chapter we tackle the computational complexity
challenge using the method of kernels.

We start the chapter by describing the idea of embedding the data into a high
dimensional feature space. We then introduce the idea of kernels. A kernel is a
type of a similarity measure between instances. The special property of kernel
similarities is that they can be viewed as inner products in some Hilbert space
(or Euclidean space of some high dimension) to which the instance space is vir-
tually embedded. We introduce the “kernel trick” that enables computationally
eﬃcient implementation of learning, without explicitly handling the high dimen-
sional representation of the domain instances. Kernel based learning algorithms,
and in particular kernel-SVM, are very useful and popular machine learning
tools. Their success may be attributed both to being ﬂexible for accommodating
domain speciﬁc prior knowledge and to having a well developed set of eﬃcient
implementation algorithms.

16.1

Embeddings into Feature Spaces

The expressive power of halfspaces is rather restricted – for example, the follow-
ing training set is not separable by a halfspace.

Let the domain be the real line; consider the domain points {−10,−9,−8, . . . , 0,
1, . . . , 9, 10} where the labels are +1 for all x such that |x| > 2 and −1 otherwise.
To make the class of halfspaces more expressive, we can ﬁrst map the original
instance space into another space (possibly of a higher dimension) and then
learn a halfspace in that space. For example, consider the example mentioned
previously. Instead of learning a halfspace in the original representation let us

Kernel Methods

ﬁrst deﬁne a mapping ψ : R → R2 as follows:

ψ(x) = (x, x2).

We use the term feature space to denote the range of ψ. After applying ψ the
data can be easily explained using the halfspace h(x) = sign((cid:104)w, ψ(x)(cid:105) − b),
where w = (0, 1) and b = 5.

The basic paradigm is as follows:

1. Given some domain set X and a learning task, choose a mapping ψ : X → F,
for some feature space F, that will usually be Rn for some n (however, the
range of such a mapping can be any Hilbert space, including such spaces of
inﬁnite dimension, as we will show later).

2. Given a sequence of labeled examples, S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym), create the

image sequence ˆS = (ψ(x1), y1), . . . , (ψ(xm), ym).

3. Train a linear predictor h over ˆS.
4. Predict the label of a test point, x, to be h(ψ(x)).

Note that, for every probability distribution D over X × Y, we can readily
deﬁne its image probability distribution Dψ over F × Y by setting, for every
subset A ⊆ F × Y, Dψ(A) = D(ψ−1(A)).1 It follows that for every predictor h
over the feature space, LDψ (h) = LD(h ◦ ψ), where h ◦ ψ is the composition of h
onto ψ.

The success of this learning paradigm depends on choosing a good ψ for a
given learning task: that is, a ψ that will make the image of the data distribution
(close to being) linearly separable in the feature space, thus making the resulting
algorithm a good learner for a given task. Picking such an embedding requires
prior knowledge about that task. However, often some generic mappings that
enable us to enrich the class of halfspaces and extend its expressiveness are used.
One notable example is polynomial mappings, which are a generalization of the
ψ we have seen in the previous example.
Recall that the prediction of a standard halfspace classiﬁer on an instance x
is based on the linear mapping x (cid:55)→ (cid:104)w, x(cid:105). We can generalize linear mappings
to a polynomial mapping, x (cid:55)→ p(x), where p is a multivariate polynomial of
degree k. For simplicity, consider ﬁrst the case in which x is 1 dimensional.
j=0 wjxj, where w ∈ Rk+1 is the vector of coeﬃcients
of the polynomial we need to learn. We can rewrite p(x) = (cid:104)w, ψ(x)(cid:105) where
ψ : R → Rk+1 is the mapping x (cid:55)→ (1, x, x2, x3, . . . , xk). It follows that
learning a k degree polynomial over R can be done by learning a linear mapping
in the (k + 1) dimensional feature space.

In that case, p(x) = (cid:80)k

More generally, a degree k multivariate polynomial from Rn to R can be writ-

ten as

p(x) =

wJ

xJi.

16.2 The Kernel Trick

217

As before, we can rewrite p(x) = (cid:104)w, ψ(x)(cid:105) where now ψ : Rn → Rd is such
that for every J ∈ [n]r, r ≤ k, the coordinate of ψ(x) associated with J is the

monomial(cid:81)r

i=1 xJi.

Naturally, polynomial-based classiﬁers yield much richer hypothesis classes
than halfspaces. We have seen at the beginning of this chapter an example in
which the training set, in its original domain (X = R), cannot be separable
by a halfspace, but after the embedding x (cid:55)→ (x, x2) it is perfectly separable.
So, while the classiﬁer is always linear in the feature space, it can have highly
nonlinear behavior on the original space from which instances were sampled.

In general, we can choose any feature mapping ψ that maps the original in-
stances into some Hilbert space.2 The Euclidean space Rd is a Hilbert space for
any ﬁnite d. But there are also inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces (as we shall
see later on in this chapter).

The bottom line of this discussion is that we can enrich the class of halfspaces
by ﬁrst applying a nonlinear mapping, ψ, that maps the instance space into some
feature space, and then learning a halfspace in that feature space. However, if
the range of ψ is a high dimensional space we face two problems. First, the VC-
dimension of halfspaces in Rn is n + 1, and therefore, if the range of ψ is very
large, we need many more samples in order to learn a halfspace in the range
of ψ. Second, from the computational point of view, performing calculations in
the high dimensional space might be too costly. In fact, even the representation
of the vector w in the feature space can be unrealistic. The ﬁrst issue can be
tackled using the paradigm of large margin (or low norm predictors), as we
already discussed in the previous chapter in the context of the SVM algorithm.
In the following section we address the computational issue.

16.2

The Kernel Trick

We have seen that embedding the input space into some high dimensional feature
space makes halfspace learning more expressive. However, the computational
complexity of such learning may still pose a serious hurdle – computing linear
separators over very high dimensional data may be computationally expensive.
The common solution to this concern is kernel based learning. The term “kernels”
is used in this context to describe inner products in the feature space. Given
an embedding ψ of some domain space X into some Hilbert space, we deﬁne
the kernel function K(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)ψ(x), ψ(x(cid:48))(cid:105). One can think of K as specifying
similarity between instances and of the embedding ψ as mapping the domain set

2 A Hilbert space is a vector space with an inner product, which is also complete. A space is

In our case, the norm (cid:107)w(cid:107) is deﬁned by the inner product(cid:112)(cid:104)w, w(cid:105). The reason we require

complete if all Cauchy sequences in the space converge.

the range of ψ to be in a Hilbert space is that projections in a Hilbert space are well
deﬁned. In particular, if M is a linear subspace of a Hilbert space, then every x in the
Hilbert space can be written as a sum x = u + v where u ∈ M and (cid:104)v, w(cid:105) = 0 for all
w ∈ M . We use this fact in the proof of the representer theorem given in the next section.

218

Kernel Methods

X into a space where these similarities are realized as inner products. It turns
out that many learning algorithms for halfspaces can be carried out just on the
basis of the values of the kernel function over pairs of domain points. The main
advantage of such algorithms is that they implement linear separators in high
dimensional feature spaces without having to specify points in that space or
expressing the embedding ψ explicitly. The remainder of this section is devoted
to constructing such algorithms.

In the previous chapter we saw that regularizing the norm of w yields a small
sample complexity even if the dimensionality of the feature space is high. Inter-
estingly, as we show later, regularizing the norm of w is also helpful in overcoming
the computational problem. To do so, ﬁrst note that all versions of the SVM op-
timization problem we have derived in the previous chapter are instances of the
following general problem:

min

w

(f ((cid:104)w, ψ(x1)(cid:105) , . . . ,(cid:104)w, ψ(xm)(cid:105)) + R((cid:107)w(cid:107))),

(16.2)
where f : Rm → R is an arbitrary function and R : R+ → R is a monotoni-
(cid:80)
cally nondecreasing function. For example, Soft-SVM for homogenous halfspaces

theorem 16.1 (Representer Theorem) Assume that ψ is a mapping from X to

a Hilbert space. Then, there exists a vector α ∈ Rm such that w =(cid:80)m

The following theorem shows that there exists an optimal solution of Equa-

is an optimal solution of Equation (16.2).

Proof Let w(cid:63) be an optimal solution of Equation (16.2). Because w(cid:63) is an
element of a Hilbert space, we can rewrite w(cid:63) as

m(cid:88)

w(cid:63) =

αiψ(xi) + u,

where (cid:104)u, ψ(xi)(cid:105) = 0 for all i. Set w = w(cid:63) − u. Clearly, (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)u(cid:107)2,
thus (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107). Since R is nondecreasing we obtain that R((cid:107)w(cid:107)) ≤ R((cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)).
Additionally, for all i we have that

i=1

(cid:104)w, ψ(xi)(cid:105) = (cid:104)w(cid:63) − u, ψ(xi)(cid:105) = (cid:104)w(cid:63), ψ(xi)(cid:105),

hence

f ((cid:104)w, ψ(x1)(cid:105) , . . . ,(cid:104)w, ψ(xm)(cid:105)) = f ((cid:104)w(cid:63), ψ(x1)(cid:105) , . . . ,(cid:104)w(cid:63), ψ(xm)(cid:105)) .

w =(cid:80)m

We have shown that the objective of Equation (16.2) at w cannot be larger
than the objective at w(cid:63) and therefore w is also an optimal solution. Since

i=1 αiψ(xi) we conclude our proof.

16.2 The Kernel Trick

w =(cid:80)m

On the basis of the representer theorem we can optimize Equation (16.2) with
respect to the coeﬃcients α instead of the coeﬃcients w as follows. Writing

(cid:42)(cid:88)

j=1 αjψ(xj) we have that for all i

(cid:104)w, ψ(xi)(cid:105) =

i,j=1

Let K(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)ψ(x), ψ(x(cid:48))(cid:105) be a function that implements the kernel function
with respect to the embedding ψ. Instead of solving Equation (16.2) we can solve
the equivalent problem

αiαjK(xj, xi)

(16.3)

i,j=1

To solve the optimization problem given in Equation (16.3), we do not need any
direct access to elements in the feature space. The only thing we should know is
how to calculate inner products in the feature space, or equivalently, to calculate
the kernel function. In fact, to solve Equation (16.3) we solely need to know the
value of the m × m matrix G s.t. Gi,j = K(xi, xj), which is often called the
Gram matrix.

In particular, specifying the preceding to the Soft-SVM problem given in Equa-

tion (15.6), we can rewrite the problem as

where (Gα)i is the i’th element of the vector obtained by multiplying the Gram
matrix G by the vector α. Note that Equation (16.4) can be written as quadratic
programming and hence can be solved eﬃciently. In the next section we describe
an even simpler algorithm for solving Soft-SVM with kernels.

Once we learn the coeﬃcients α we can calculate the prediction on a new

instance by

(cid:104)w, ψ(x)(cid:105) =

The advantage of working with kernels rather than directly optimizing w in
the feature space is that in some situations the dimension of the feature space

220

is extremely large while implementing the kernel function is very simple. A few
examples are given in the following.

Example 16.1 (Polynomial Kernels) The k degree polynomial kernel is deﬁned
to be

K(x, x(cid:48)) = (1 + (cid:104)x, x(cid:48)(cid:105))k.

Now we will show that this is indeed a kernel function. That is, we will show
that there exists a mapping ψ from the original space to some higher dimensional
space for which K(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)ψ(x), ψ(x(cid:48))(cid:105). For simplicity, denote x0 = x(cid:48)
0 = 1.
Then, we have

K(x, x(cid:48)) = (1 + (cid:104)x, x(cid:48)(cid:105))k = (1 + (cid:104)x, x(cid:48)(cid:105)) · ··· · (1 + (cid:104)x, x(cid:48)(cid:105))

such that for J ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}k there is an

i=1 xJi, we obtain that
K(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)ψ(x), ψ(x(cid:48))(cid:105).

Since ψ contains all the monomials up to degree k, a halfspace over the range
of ψ corresponds to a polynomial predictor of degree k over the original space.
Hence, learning a halfspace with a k degree polynomial kernel enables us to learn
polynomial predictors of degree k over the original space.

Note that here the complexity of implementing K is O(n) while the dimension

of the feature space is on the order of nk.
Example 16.2 (Gaussian Kernel) Let the original instance space be R and
consider the mapping ψ where for each nonnegative integer n ≥ 0 there exists
an element ψ(x)n that equals

be

K(x, x(cid:48)) = e

−(cid:107)x−x(cid:48)(cid:107)2

.

Intuitively, the Gaussian kernel sets the inner product in the feature space
between x, x(cid:48) to be close to zero if the instances are far away from each other
(in the original domain) and close to 1 if they are close. σ is a parameter that
controls the scale determining what we mean by “close.” It is easy to verify that
K implements an inner product in a space in which for any n and any monomial

of order k there exists an element of ψ(x) that equals

i=1 xJi.
Hence, we can learn any polynomial predictor over the original space by using a
Gaussian kernel.

Recall that the VC-dimension of the class of all polynomial predictors is inﬁ-
nite (see Exercise 12). There is no contradiction, because the sample complexity
required to learn with Gaussian kernels depends on the margin in the feature
space, which will be large if we are lucky, but can in general be arbitrarily small.
The Gaussian kernel is also called the RBF kernel, for “Radial Basis Func-

tions.”

16.2.1

Kernels as a Way to Express Prior Knowledge

As we discussed previously, a feature mapping, ψ, may be viewed as expanding
the class of linear classiﬁers to a richer class (corresponding to linear classiﬁers
over the feature space). However, as discussed in the book so far, the suitability
of any hypothesis class to a given learning task depends on the nature of that
task. One can therefore think of an embedding ψ as a way to express and utilize
prior knowledge about the problem at hand. For example, if we believe that
positive examples can be distinguished by some ellipse, we can deﬁne ψ to be all
the monomials up to order 2, or use a degree 2 polynomial kernel.

As a more realistic example, consider the task of learning to ﬁnd a sequence of
characters (“signature”) in a ﬁle that indicates whether it contains a virus or not.
Formally, let Xd be the set of all strings of length at most d over some alphabet
set Σ. The hypothesis class that one wishes to learn is H = {hv : v ∈ Xd}, where,
for a string x ∈ Xd, hv(x) is 1 iﬀ v is a substring of x (and hv(x) = −1 otherwise).
Let us show how using an appropriate embedding this class can be realized by
linear classiﬁers over the resulting feature space. Consider a mapping ψ to a space
Rs where s = |Xd|, so that each coordinate of ψ(x) corresponds to some string v
and indicates whether v is a substring of x (that is, for every x ∈ Xd, ψ(x) is a
vector in {0, 1}|Xd|). Note that the dimension of this feature space is exponential
in d. It is not hard to see that every member of the class H can be realized by
composing a linear classiﬁer over ψ(x), and, moreover, by such a halfspace whose
norm is 1 and that attains a margin of 1 (see Exercise 1). Furthermore, for every
x ∈ X , (cid:107)ψ(x)(cid:107) = O(d). So, overall, it is learnable using SVM with a sample

222

Kernel Methods

complexity that is polynomial in d. However, the dimension of the feature space
is exponential in d so a direct implementation of SVM over the feature space is
problematic. Luckily, it is easy to calculate the inner product in the feature space
(i.e., the kernel function) without explicitly mapping instances into the feature
space. Indeed, K(x, x(cid:48)) is simply the number of common substrings of x and x(cid:48),
which can be easily calculated in time polynomial in d.

This example also demonstrates how feature mapping enables us to use halfspaces

for nonvectorial domains.

16.2.2

Characterizing Kernel Functions*

As we have discussed in the previous section, we can think of the speciﬁcation of
the kernel matrix as a way to express prior knowledge. Consider a given similarity
function of the form K : X × X → R. Is it a valid kernel function? That is, does
it represent an inner product between ψ(x) and ψ(x(cid:48)) for some feature mapping
ψ? The following lemma gives a suﬃcient and necessary condition.
lemma 16.2 A symmetric function K : X × X → R implements an inner
product in some Hilbert space if and only if it is positive semideﬁnite; namely,
for all x1, . . . , xm, the Gram matrix, Gi,j = K(xi, xj), is a positive semideﬁnite
matrix.

Proof
It is trivial to see that if K implements an inner product in some Hilbert
space then the Gram matrix is positive semideﬁnite. For the other direction,
deﬁne the space of functions over X as RX = {f : X → R}. For each x ∈ X
let ψ(x) be the function x (cid:55)→ K(·, x). Deﬁne a vector space by taking all linear
combinations of elements of the form K(·, x). Deﬁne an inner product on this

vector space to be(cid:42)(cid:88)

This is a valid inner product since it is symmetric (because K is symmetric), it is
linear (immediate), and it is positive deﬁnite (it is easy to see that K(x, x) ≥ 0
with equality only for ψ(x) being the zero function). Clearly,
(cid:104)ψ(x), ψ(x(cid:48))(cid:105) = (cid:104)K(·, x), K(·, x(cid:48))(cid:105) = K(x, x(cid:48)),

which concludes our proof.

16.3

Implementing Soft-SVM with Kernels

Next, we turn to solving Soft-SVM with kernels. While we could have designed
an algorithm for solving Equation (16.4), there is an even simpler approach that

while only using kernel evaluations. The basic observation is that the vector w(t)
maintained by the SGD procedure we have described in Section 15.5 is always in
the linear span of {ψ(x1), . . . , ψ(xm)}. Therefore, rather than maintaining w(t)
we can maintain the corresponding coeﬃcients α.
Formally, let K be the kernel function, namely, for all x, x(cid:48), K(x, x(cid:48)) =
(cid:104)ψ(x), ψ(x(cid:48))(cid:105). We shall maintain two vectors in Rm, corresponding to two vectors

Summary

Mappings from the given domain to some higher dimensional space, on which a
halfspace predictor is used, can be highly powerful. We beneﬁt from a rich and
complex hypothesis class, yet need to solve the problems of high sample and
computational complexities. In Chapter 10, we discussed the AdaBoost algo-
rithm, which faces these challenges by using a weak learner: Even though we’re
in a very high dimensional space, we have an “oracle” that bestows on us a
single good coordinate to work with on each iteration. In this chapter we intro-
duced a diﬀerent approach, the kernel trick. The idea is that in order to ﬁnd a
halfspace predictor in the high dimensional space, we do not need to know the
representation of instances in that space, but rather the values of inner products
between the mapped instances. Calculating inner products between instances in
the high dimensional space without using their representation in that space is
done using kernel functions. We have also shown how the SGD algorithm can be
implemented using kernels.

The ideas of feature mapping and the kernel trick allow us to use the framework
of halfspaces and linear predictors for nonvectorial data. We demonstrated how
kernels can be used to learn predictors over the domain of strings.

We presented the applicability of the kernel trick in SVM. However, the kernel
trick can be applied in many other algorithms. A few examples are given as
exercises.

This chapter ends the series of chapters on linear predictors and convex prob-
lems. The next two chapters deal with completely diﬀerent types of hypothesis
classes.

Bibliographic Remarks

In the context of SVM, the kernel-trick has been introduced in Boser et al. (1992).
See also Aizerman, Braverman & Rozonoer (1964). The observation that the
kernel-trick can be applied whenever an algorithm only relies on inner products
was ﬁrst stated by Sch¨olkopf, Smola & M¨uller (1998). The proof of the representer
theorem is given in (Sch¨olkopf, Herbrich, Smola & Williamson 2000, Sch¨olkopf,
Herbrich & Smola 2001). The conditions stated in Lemma 16.2 are simpliﬁcation
of conditions due to Mercer. Many useful kernel functions have been introduced
in the literature for various applications. We refer the reader to Sch¨olkopf &
Smola (2002).

customer bought, and let yi ∈ {±1} be the label indicating whether this
customer has a baby. As prior knowledge, the manager knows that there are
k items such that the label is determined to be 1 iﬀ the customer bought
at least one of these k items. Of course, the identity of these k items is not
known (otherwise, there was nothing to learn). In addition, according to the

17 Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex

Prediction Problems

Multiclass categorization is the problem of classifying instances into one of several
possible target classes. That is, we are aiming at learning a predictor h : X → Y,
where Y is a ﬁnite set of categories. Applications include, for example, catego-
rizing documents according to topic (X is the set of documents and Y is the set
of possible topics) or determining which object appears in a given image (X is
the set of images and Y is the set of possible objects).

The centrality of the multiclass learning problem has spurred the development
of various approaches for tackling the task. Perhaps the most straightforward
approach is a reduction from multiclass classiﬁcation to binary classiﬁcation. In
Section 17.1 we discuss the most common two reductions as well as the main
drawback of the reduction approach.

We then turn to describe a family of linear predictors for multiclass problems.
Relying on the RLM and SGD frameworks from previous chapters, we describe
several practical algorithms for multiclass prediction.

In Section 17.3 we show how to use the multiclass machinery for complex pre-
diction problems in which Y can be extremely large but has some structure on
it. This task is often called structured output learning. In particular, we demon-
strate this approach for the task of recognizing handwritten words, in which Y
is the set of all possible strings of some bounded length (hence, the size of Y is
exponential in the maximal length of a word).

Finally, in Section 17.4 and Section 17.5 we discuss ranking problems in which
the learner should order a set of instances according to their “relevance.” A typ-
ical application is ordering results of a search engine according to their relevance
to the query. We describe several performance measures that are adequate for
assessing the performance of ranking predictors and describe how to learn linear
predictors for ranking problems eﬃciently.

17.1

One-versus-All and All-Pairs

The simplest approach to tackle multiclass prediction problems is by reduction
to binary classiﬁcation. Recall that in multiclass prediction we would like to learn

siﬁers, each of which discriminates between one class and the rest of the classes.
That is, given a training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym), where every yi is in Y, we
construct k binary training sets, S1, . . . , Sk, where Si = (x1, (−1)1[y1(cid:54)=i] ), . . . , (xm, (−1)1[ym(cid:54)=i] ).
In words, Si is the set of instances labeled 1 if their label in S was i, and −1
otherwise. For every i ∈ [k] we train a binary predictor hi : X → {±1} based on
Si, hoping that hi(x) should equal 1 if and only if x belongs to class i. Then,
given h1, . . . , hk, we construct a multiclass predictor using the rule

h(x) ∈ argmax
i∈[k]

hi(x).

(17.1)

When more than one binary hypothesis predicts “1” we should somehow decide
which class to predict (e.g., we can arbitrarily decide to break ties by taking the
minimal index in argmaxi hi(x)). A better approach can be applied whenever
each hi hides additional information, which can be interpreted as the conﬁdence
in the prediction y = i. For example, this is the case in halfspaces, where the
actual prediction is sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)), but we can interpret (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) as the conﬁdence
in the prediction. In such cases, we can apply the multiclass rule given in Equa-
tion (17.1) on the real valued predictions. A pseudocode of the One-versus-All
approach is given in the following.

One-versus-All

input:

training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)
algorithm for binary classiﬁcation A
foreach i ∈ Y
let Si = (x1, (−1)1[y1(cid:54)=i] ), . . . , (xm, (−1)1[ym(cid:54)=i] )
let hi = A(Si)
output:
the multiclass hypothesis deﬁned by h(x) ∈ argmaxi∈Y hi(x)

Another popular reduction is the All-Pairs approach, in which all pairs of
classes are compared to each other. Formally, given a training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym),
where every yi is in [k], for every 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k we construct a binary training
sequence, Si,j, containing all examples from S whose label is either i or j. For
each such an example, we set the binary label in Si,j to be +1 if the multiclass
label in S is i and −1 if the multiclass label in S is j. Next, we train a binary
classiﬁcation algorithm based on every Si,j to get hi,j. Finally, we construct
a multiclass classiﬁer by predicting the class that had the highest number of
“wins.” A pseudocode of the All-Pairs approach is given in the following.

output:

Although reduction methods such as the One-versus-All and All-Pairs are
simple and easy to construct from existing algorithms, their simplicity has a
price. The binary learner is not aware of the fact that we are going to use its
output hypotheses for constructing a multiclass predictor, and this might lead
to suboptimal results, as illustrated in the following example.

Example 17.1 Consider a multiclass categorization problem in which the in-
stance space is X = R2 and the label set is Y = {1, 2, 3}. Suppose that instances
of the diﬀerent classes are located in nonintersecting balls as depicted in the fol-
lowing.

Suppose that the probability masses of classes 1, 2, 3 are 40%, 20%, and 40%,
respectively. Consider the application of One-versus-All to this problem, and as-
sume that the binary classiﬁcation algorithm used by One-versus-All is ERM
with respect to the hypothesis class of halfspaces. Observe that for the prob-
lem of discriminating between class 2 and the rest of the classes, the optimal
halfspace would be the all negative classiﬁer. Therefore, the multiclass predic-
tor constructed by One-versus-All might err on all the examples from class 2
(this will be the case if the tie in the deﬁnition of h(x) is broken by the nu-
merical value of the class label). In contrast, if we choose hi(x) = (cid:104)wi, x(cid:105),
where w1 =
, then the classi-
ﬁer deﬁned by h(x) = argmaxi hi(x) perfectly predicts all the examples. We see

that even though the approximation error of the class of predictors of the form
h(x) = argmaxi(cid:104)wi, x(cid:105) is zero, the One-versus-All approach might fail to ﬁnd a
good predictor from this class.

17.2

Linear Multiclass Predictors

In light of the inadequacy of reduction methods, in this section we study a more
direct approach for learning multiclass predictors. We describe the family of
linear multiclass predictors. To motivate the construction of this family, recall
that a linear predictor for binary classiﬁcation (i.e., a halfspace) takes the form

h(x) = sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)).

An equivalent way to express the prediction is as follows:

h(x) = argmax
y∈{±1}

(cid:104)w, yx(cid:105),

where yx is the vector obtained by multiplying each element of x by y.
This representation leads to a natural generalization of halfspaces to multiclass
problems as follows. Let Ψ : X × Y → Rd be a class-sensitive feature mapping.
That is, Ψ takes as input a pair (x, y) and maps it into a d dimensional feature
vector. Intuitively, we can think of the elements of Ψ(x, y) as score functions that
assess how well the label y ﬁts the instance x. We will elaborate on Ψ later on.
Given Ψ and a vector w ∈ Rd, we can deﬁne a multiclass predictor, h : X → Y,
as follows:

h(x) = argmax

y∈Y

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105).

That is, the prediction of h for the input x is the label that achieves the highest
weighted score, where weighting is according to the vector w.
Let W be some set of vectors in Rd, for example, W = {w ∈ Rd : (cid:107)w(cid:107) ≤ B},
for some scalar B > 0. Each pair (Ψ, W ) deﬁnes a hypothesis class of multiclass
predictors:

HΨ,W = {x (cid:55)→ argmax
y∈Y

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105) : w ∈ W}.

Of course, the immediate question, which we discuss in the sequel, is how to
construct a good Ψ. Note that if Y = {±1} and we set Ψ(x, y) = yx and
W = Rd, then HΨ,W becomes the hypothesis class of homogeneous halfspace
predictors for binary classiﬁcation.

17.2.1

How to Construct Ψ

As mentioned before, we can think of the elements of Ψ(x, y) as score functions
that assess how well the label y ﬁts the instance x. Naturally, designing a good Ψ
is similar to the problem of designing a good feature mapping (as we discussed in

17.2 Linear Multiclass Predictors

231

Chapter 16 and as we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 25). Two examples
of useful constructions are given in the following.

The Multivector Construction:
Let Y = {1, . . . , k} and let X = Rn. We deﬁne Ψ : X × Y → Rd, where d = nk,
as follows

(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)

(cid:124)

Ψ(x, y) = [ 0, . . . , 0
∈R(y−1)n

, x1, . . . , xn

(cid:123)(cid:122)

∈Rn

(cid:125)

(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)

, 0, . . . , 0
∈R(k−y)n

].

(17.2)

That is, Ψ(x, y) is composed of k vectors, each of which is of dimension n, where
we set all the vectors to be the all zeros vector except the y’th vector, which is
set to be x. It follows that we can think of w ∈ Rnk as being composed of k
weight vectors in Rn, that is, w = [w1;
; wk], hence the name multivec-
tor construction. By the construction we have that (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105) = (cid:104)wy, x(cid:105), and
therefore the multiclass prediction becomes

. . .

h(x) = argmax

y∈Y

(cid:104)wy, x(cid:105).

A geometric illustration of the multiclass prediction over X = R2 is given in the
following.

TF-IDF:
The previous deﬁnition of Ψ(x, y) does not incorporate any prior knowledge
about the problem. We next describe an example of a feature function Ψ that
does incorporate prior knowledge. Let X be a set of text documents and Y be a
set of possible topics. Let d be a size of a dictionary of words. For each word in the
dictionary, whose corresponding index is j, let T F (j, x) be the number of times
the word corresponding to j appears in the document x. This quantity is called
Term-Frequency. Additionally, let DF (j, y) be the number of times the word
corresponding to j appears in documents in our training set that are not about
topic y. This quantity is called Document-Frequency and measures whether word
j is frequent in other topics. Now, deﬁne Ψ : X × Y → Rd to be such that

(cid:16) m

(cid:17)

,

Ψj(x, y) = T F (j, x) log

DF (j,y)

where m is the total number of documents in our training set. The preced-
ing quantity is called term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency or TF-IDF for

232

Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex Prediction Problems

short. Intuitively, Ψj(x, y) should be large if the word corresponding to j ap-
pears a lot in the document x but does not appear at all in documents that are
not on topic y. If this is the case, we tend to believe that the document x is on
topic y. Note that unlike the multivector construction described previously, in
the current construction the dimension of Ψ does not depend on the number of
topics (i.e., the size of Y).

17.2.2

Cost-Sensitive Classiﬁcation

So far we used the zero-one loss as our performance measure of the quality of
h(x). That is, the loss of a hypothesis h on an example (x, y) is 1 if h(x) (cid:54)= y and
0 otherwise. In some situations it makes more sense to penalize diﬀerent levels
of loss for diﬀerent mistakes. For example, in object recognition tasks, it is less
severe to predict that an image of a tiger contains a cat than predicting that
the image contains a whale. This can be modeled by specifying a loss function,
∆ : Y × Y → R+, where for every pair of labels, y(cid:48), y, the loss of predicting
the label y(cid:48) when the correct label is y is deﬁned to be ∆(y(cid:48), y). We assume
that ∆(y, y) = 0. Note that the zero-one loss can be easily modeled by setting
∆(y(cid:48), y) = 1[y(cid:48)(cid:54)=y].

17.2.3

ERM
We have deﬁned the hypothesis class HΨ,W and speciﬁed a loss function ∆. To
learn the class with respect to the loss function, we can apply the ERM rule with
respect to this class. That is, we search for a multiclass hypothesis h ∈ HΨ,W ,
parameterized by a vector w, that minimizes the empirical risk with respect to
∆,

m(cid:88)

i=1

LS(h) =

1
m

∆(h(xi), yi).

We now show that when W = Rd and we are in the realizable case, then it is
possible to solve the ERM problem eﬃciently using linear programming. Indeed,
in the realizable case, we need to ﬁnd a vector w ∈ Rd that satisﬁes

∀i ∈ [m],

yi = argmax

y∈Y

(cid:104)w, Ψ(xi, y)(cid:105).

Equivalently, we need that w will satisfy the following set of linear inequalities

∀i ∈ [m], ∀y ∈ Y \ {yi},

(cid:104)w, Ψ(xi, yi)(cid:105) > (cid:104)w, Ψ(xi, y)(cid:105).

Finding w that satisﬁes the preceding set of linear equations amounts to solving
a linear program.

As in the case of binary classiﬁcation, it is also possible to use a generalization

of the Perceptron algorithm for solving the ERM problem. See Exercise 2.

In the nonrealizable case, solving the ERM problem is in general computa-
tionally hard. We tackle this diﬃculty using the method of convex surrogate

17.2 Linear Multiclass Predictors

233

loss functions (see Section 12.3). In particular, we generalize the hinge loss to
multiclass problems.

17.2.4

Generalized Hinge Loss
Recall that in binary classiﬁcation, the hinge loss is deﬁned to be max{0, 1 −
y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)}. We now generalize the hinge loss to multiclass predictors of the form

hw(x) = argmax

y(cid:48)∈Y

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y(cid:48))(cid:105).

Recall that a surrogate convex loss should upper bound the original nonconvex
loss, which in our case is ∆(hw(x), y). To derive an upper bound on ∆(hw(x), y)
we ﬁrst note that the deﬁnition of hw(x) implies that

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, hw(x))(cid:105).

Therefore,

∆(hw(x), y) ≤ ∆(hw(x), y) + (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, hw(x)) − Ψ(x, y)(cid:105).

Since hw(x) ∈ Y we can upper bound the right-hand side of the preceding by

y(cid:48)∈Y (∆(y(cid:48), y) + (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y(cid:48)) − Ψ(x, y)(cid:105))

max

def= (cid:96)(w, (x, y)).

(17.3)

We use the term “generalized hinge loss” to denote the preceding expression. As
we have shown, (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) ≥ ∆(hw(x), y). Furthermore, equality holds when-
ever the score of the correct label is larger than the score of any other label, y(cid:48),
by at least ∆(y(cid:48), y), namely,

∀y(cid:48) ∈ Y \ {y},

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105) ≥ (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y(cid:48))(cid:105) + ∆(y(cid:48), y).

It is also immediate to see that (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) is a convex function with respect to w
since it is a maximum over linear functions of w (see Claim 12.5 in Chapter 12),
and that (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) is ρ-Lipschitz with ρ = maxy(cid:48)∈Y (cid:107)Ψ(x, y(cid:48)) − Ψ(x, y)(cid:107).
Remark 17.2 We use the name “generalized hinge loss” since in the binary
case, when Y = {±1}, if we set Ψ(x, y) = yx
2 , then the generalized hinge loss
becomes the vanilla hinge loss for binary classiﬁcation,

(cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = max{0, 1 − y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)}.

Geometric Intuition:
The feature function Ψ : X × Y → Rd maps each x into |Y| vectors in Rd.
The value of (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) will be zero if there exists a direction w such that
when projecting the |Y| vectors onto this direction we obtain that each vector is
represented by the scalar (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105), and we can rank the diﬀerent points on
the basis of these scalars so that
• The point corresponding to the correct y is top-ranked

234

Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex Prediction Problems

• For each y(cid:48) (cid:54)= y, the diﬀerence between (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105) and (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y(cid:48))(cid:105) is larger
than the loss of predicting y(cid:48) instead of y. The diﬀerence (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105) −
(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y(cid:48))(cid:105) is also referred to as the “margin” (see Section 15.1).

This is illustrated in the following ﬁgure:

Multiclass SVM and SGD

Once we have deﬁned the generalized hinge loss, we obtain a convex-Lipschitz
learning problem and we can apply our general techniques for solving such prob-
lems. In particular, the RLM technique we have studied in Chapter 13 yields the
multiclass SVM rule:

We can solve the optimization problem associated with multiclass SVM us-
ing generic convex optimization algorithms (or using the method described in
Section 15.5). Let us analyze the risk of the resulting hypothesis. The analysis
seamlessly follows from our general analysis for convex-Lipschitz problems given
in Chapter 13. In particular, applying Corollary 13.8 and using the fact that the
generalized hinge loss upper bounds the ∆ loss, we immediately obtain an analog
of Corollary 15.7:
corollary 17.1 Let D be a distribution over X × Y, let Ψ : X × Y → Rd,
and assume that for all x ∈ X and y ∈ Y we have (cid:107)Ψ(x, y)(cid:107) ≤ ρ/2. Let B > 0.

deﬁnition of the generalized hinge loss. This yields the following algorithm:

Remark 17.3
It is interesting to note that the risk bounds given in Corol-

set Y, a fact we will rely on in the next section. However, the bounds may de-
pend implicitly on the size of Y via the norm of Ψ(x, y) and the fact that the

Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex Prediction Problems

17.3

Structured Output Prediction
Structured output prediction problems are multiclass problems in which Y is
very large but is endowed with a predeﬁned structure. The structure plays a
key role in constructing eﬃcient algorithms. To motivate structured learning
problems, consider the problem of optical character recognition (OCR). Suppose
we receive an image of some handwritten word and would like to predict which
word is written in the image. To simplify the setting, suppose we know how to
segment the image into a sequence of images, each of which contains a patch of
the image corresponding to a single letter. Therefore, X is the set of sequences
of images and Y is the set of sequences of letters. Note that the size of Y grows
exponentially with the maximal length of a word. An example of an image x
corresponding to the label y = “workable” is given in the following.

To tackle structure prediction we can rely on the family of linear predictors
described in the previous section. In particular, we need to deﬁne a reasonable
loss function for the problem, ∆, as well as a good class-sensitive feature mapping,
Ψ. By “good” we mean a feature mapping that will lead to a low approximation
error for the class of linear predictors with respect to Ψ and ∆. Once we do this,
we can rely, for example, on the SGD learning algorithm deﬁned in the previous
section.

However, the huge size of Y poses several challenges:

1. To apply the multiclass prediction we need to solve a maximization problem

over Y. How can we predict eﬃciently when Y is so large?

2. How do we train w eﬃciently? In particular, to apply the SGD rule we again

need to solve a maximization problem over Y.

3. How can we avoid overﬁtting?

In the previous section we have already shown that the sample complexity of
learning a linear multiclass predictor does not depend explicitly on the number
of classes. We just need to make sure that the norm of the range of Ψ is not too
large. This will take care of the overﬁtting problem. To tackle the computational
challenges we rely on the structure of the problem, and deﬁne the functions Ψ and
∆ so that calculating the maximization problems in the deﬁnition of hw and in
the SGD algorithm can be performed eﬃciently. In the following we demonstrate
one way to achieve these goals for the OCR task mentioned previously.

To simplify the presentation, let us assume that all the words in Y are of length
r and that the number of diﬀerent letters in our alphabet is q. Let y and y(cid:48) be two

17.3 Structured Output Prediction

237

words (i.e., sequences of letters) in Y. We deﬁne the function ∆(y(cid:48), y) to be the
average number of letters that are diﬀerent in y(cid:48) and y, namely, 1
1[yi(cid:54)=y(cid:48)
i].
Next, let us deﬁne a class-sensitive feature mapping Ψ(x, y). It will be conve-
nient to think about x as a matrix of size n × r, where n is the number of pixels
in each image, and r is the number of images in the sequence. The j’th column
of x corresponds to the j’th image in the sequence (encoded as a vector of gray
level values of pixels). The dimension of the range of Ψ is set to be d = n q + q2.

i=1

r

The ﬁrst nq feature functions are “type 1” features and take the form:

(cid:80)r

Ψi,j,1(x, y) =

1
r

xi,t 1[yt=j].

r(cid:88)

t=1

r(cid:88)

t=2

That is, we sum the value of the i’th pixel only over the images for which y
assigns the letter j. The triple index (i, j, 1) indicates that we are dealing with
feature (i, j) of type 1. Intuitively, such features can capture pixels in the image
whose gray level values are indicative of a certain letter. The second type of
features take the form

Ψi,j,2(x, y) =

1
r

1[yt=i] 1[yt−1=j].

That is, we sum the number of times the letter i follows the letter j. Intuitively,
these features can capture rules like “It is likely to see the pair ‘qu’ in a word”
or “It is unlikely to see the pair ‘rz’ in a word.” Of course, some of these features
will not be very useful, so the goal of the learning process is to assign weights to
features by learning the vector w, so that the weighted score will give us a good
prediction via

hw(x) = argmax

y∈Y

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105).

It is left to show how to solve the optimization problem in the deﬁnition
of hw(x) eﬃciently, as well as how to solve the optimization problem in the
deﬁnition of ˆy in the SGD algorithm. We can do this by applying a dynamic
programming procedure. We describe the procedure for solving the maximization
in the deﬁnition of hw and leave as an exercise the maximization problem in the
deﬁnition of ˆy in the SGD algorithm.

To derive the dynamic programming procedure, let us ﬁrst observe that we

can write

Ψ(x, y) =

r(cid:88)

φ(x, yt, yt−1),

t=1

for an appropriate φ : X × [q] × [q] ∪ {0} → Rd, and for simplicity we assume
that y0 is always equal to 0. Indeed, each feature function Ψi,j,1 can be written
in terms of

φi,j,1(x, yt, yt−1) = xi,t 1[yt=j],

238

Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex Prediction Problems

while the feature function Ψi,j,2 can be written in terms of

φi,j,2(x, yt, yt−1) = 1[yt=i] 1[yt−1=j].

Therefore, the prediction can be written as

hw(x) = argmax

y∈Y

(cid:104)w, φ(x, yt, yt−1)(cid:105).

(17.4)

In the following we derive a dynamic programming procedure that solves every
problem of the form given in Equation (17.4). The procedure will maintain a
matrix M ∈ Rq,r such that

r(cid:88)

τ(cid:88)

t=1

Ms,τ =

max

(y1,...,yτ ):yτ =s

(cid:104)w, φ(x, yt, yt−1)(cid:105).

Clearly, the maximum of (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, y)(cid:105) equals maxs Ms,r. Furthermore, we can
calculate M in a recursive manner:

Ms,τ = max

s(cid:48)

(Ms(cid:48),τ−1 + (cid:104)w, φ(x, s, s(cid:48))(cid:105)) .

(17.5)

This yields the following procedure:

Ranking

Ranking is the problem of ordering a set of instances according to their “rele-
vance.” A typical application is ordering results of a search engine according to
their relevance to the query. Another example is a system that monitors elec-
tronic transactions and should alert for possible fraudulent transactions. Such a
system should order transactions according to how suspicious they are.

X of arbitrary length. A ranking hypothesis, h, is a function that receives a
sequence of instances ¯x = (x1, . . . , xr) ∈ X ∗, and returns a permutation of [r].
It is more convenient to let the output of h be a vector y ∈ Rr, where by
sorting the elements of y we obtain the permutation over [r]. We denote by
π(y) the permutation over [r] induced by y. For example, for r = 5, the vector
y = (2, 1, 6,−1, 0.5) induces the permutation π(y) = (4, 3, 5, 1, 2). That is,
if we sort y in an ascending order, then we obtain the vector (−1, 0.5, 1, 2, 6).
Now, π(y)i is the position of yi in the sorted vector (−1, 0.5, 1, 2, 6). This
notation reﬂects that the top-ranked instances are those that achieve the highest
(cid:83)∞
values in π(y).
In the notation of our PAC learning model, the examples domain is Z =
r=1(X r × Rr), and the hypothesis class, H, is some set of ranking hypotheses.
we deﬁne (cid:96)(h, (¯x, y)) = ∆(h(¯x), y), for some function ∆ :(cid:83)∞
We next turn to describe loss functions for ranking. There are many possible ways
to deﬁne such loss functions, and here we list a few examples. In all the examples
r=1(Rr × Rr) → R+.
• 0–1 Ranking loss: ∆(y(cid:48), y) is zero if y and y(cid:48) induce exactly the same
ranking and ∆(y(cid:48), y) = 1 otherwise. That is, ∆(y(cid:48), y) = 1[π(y(cid:48))(cid:54)=π(y)]. Such
a loss function is almost never used in practice as it does not distinguish
between the case in which π(y(cid:48)) is almost equal to π(y) and the case in
which π(y(cid:48)) is completely diﬀerent from π(y).
• Kendall-Tau Loss: We count the number of pairs (i, j) that are in diﬀerent

order in the two permutations. This can be written as

∆(y(cid:48), y) =

2

r(r − 1)

1[sign(y(cid:48)

i−y(cid:48)

j )(cid:54)=sign(yi−yj )].

r−1(cid:88)

r(cid:88)

i=1

j=i+1

This loss function is more useful than the 0–1 loss as it reﬂects the level of
similarity between the two rankings.
• Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG): This measure em-
phasizes the correctness at the top of the list by using a monotonically
nondecreasing discount function D : N → R+. We ﬁrst deﬁne a discounted
cumulative gain measure:

G(y(cid:48), y) =

D(π(y(cid:48))i) yi.

r(cid:88)

i=1

In words, if we interpret yi as a score of the “true relevance” of item i, then
we take a weighted sum of the relevance of the elements, while the weight
of yi is determined on the basis of the position of i in π(y(cid:48)). Assuming that
all elements of y are nonnegative, it is easy to verify that 0 ≤ G(y(cid:48), y) ≤
G(y, y). We can therefore deﬁne a normalized discounted cumulative gain
by the ratio G(y(cid:48), y)/G(y, y), and the corresponding loss function would
be

∆(y(cid:48), y) = 1 − G(y(cid:48), y)

=

G(y, y)

G(y, y)

i=1

(D(π(y)i) − D(π(y(cid:48))i)) yi.

240

Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex Prediction Problems

We can easily see that ∆(y(cid:48), y) ∈ [0, 1] and that ∆(y(cid:48), y) = 0 whenever
π(y(cid:48)) = π(y).

A typical way to deﬁne the discount function is by

(cid:40)

D(i) =

1

log2(r−i+2)
0

if i ∈ {r − k + 1, . . . , r}
otherwise

where k < r is a parameter. This means that we care more about elements
that are ranked higher, and we completely ignore elements that are not at
the top-k ranked elements. The NDCG measure is often used to evaluate
the performance of search engines since in such applications it makes sense
completely to ignore elements that are not at the top of the ranking.

Once we have a hypothesis class and a ranking loss function, we can learn a
ranking function using the ERM rule. However, from the computational point of
view, the resulting optimization problem might be hard to solve. We next discuss
how to learn linear predictors for ranking.

17.4.1

Linear Predictors for Ranking

A natural way to deﬁne a ranking function is by projecting the instances onto
some vector w and then outputting the resulting scalars as our representation
of the ranking function. That is, assuming that X ⊂ Rd, for every w ∈ Rd we
deﬁne a ranking function

hw((x1, . . . , xr)) = ((cid:104)w, x1(cid:105), . . . ,(cid:104)w, xr(cid:105)).

(17.6)

As we discussed in Chapter 16, we can also apply a feature mapping that maps
instances into some feature space and then takes the inner products with w in the
feature space. For simplicity, we focus on the simpler form as in Equation (17.6).
Given some W ⊂ Rd, we can now deﬁne the hypothesis class HW = {hw :
w ∈ W}. Once we have deﬁned this hypothesis class, and have chosen a ranking
loss function, we can apply the ERM rule as follows: Given a training set, S =
(¯x1, y1), . . . , (¯xm, ym), where each (¯xi, yi) is in (X × R)ri, for some ri ∈ N, we
i=1 ∆(hw(¯xi), yi).
As in the case of binary classiﬁcation, for many loss functions this problem is
computationally hard, and we therefore turn to describe convex surrogate loss
functions. We describe the surrogates for the Kendall tau loss and for the NDCG
loss.

should search w ∈ W that minimizes the empirical loss, (cid:80)m

A Hinge Loss for the Kendall Tau Loss Function:
We can think of the Kendall tau loss as an average of 0−1 losses for each pair.
In particular, for every (i, j) we can rewrite

1[sign(y(cid:48)

i−y(cid:48)

j )(cid:54)=sign(yi−yj )] = 1[sign(yi−yj )(y(cid:48)

i−y(cid:48)

j )≤0].

17.4 Ranking

241

i− y(cid:48)
In our case, y(cid:48)
bound as follows:

j = (cid:104)w, xi− xj(cid:105). It follows that we can use the hinge loss upper

1[sign(yi−yj )(y(cid:48)

i−y(cid:48)

j )≤0] ≤ max{0, 1 − sign (yi − yj)(cid:104)w, xi − xj(cid:105)} .

Taking the average over the pairs we obtain the following surrogate convex loss
for the Kendall tau loss function:

∆(hw(¯x), y) ≤

2

r(r − 1)

max{0, 1 − sign(yi − yj)(cid:104)w, xi − xj(cid:105)} .

r−1(cid:88)

j=i+1

The right-hand side is convex with respect to w and upper bounds the Kendall
tau loss. It is also a ρ-Lipschitz function with parameter ρ ≤ maxi,j (cid:107)xi − xj(cid:107).

A Hinge Loss for the NDCG Loss Function:
The NDCG loss function depends on the predicted ranking vector y(cid:48) ∈ Rr via
the permutation it induces. To derive a surrogate loss function we ﬁrst make
the following observation. Let V be the set of all permutations of [r] encoded as
vectors; namely, each v ∈ V is a vector in [r]r such that for all i (cid:54)= j we have
vi (cid:54)= vj. Then (see Exercise 4),

Let us denote Ψ(¯x, v) =(cid:80)r

On the basis of this observation, we can use the generalized hinge loss for cost-
sensitive multiclass classiﬁcation as a surrogate loss function for the NDCG loss
as follows:

∆(hw(¯x), y) ≤ ∆(hw(¯x), y) + (cid:104)w, Ψ(¯x, π(hw(¯x)))(cid:105) − (cid:104)w, Ψ(¯x, π(y))(cid:105)

(cid:35)

The right-hand side is a convex function with respect to w.

We can now solve the learning problem using SGD as described in Section 17.2.5.

The main computational bottleneck is calculating a subgradient of the loss func-
tion, which is equivalent to ﬁnding v that achieves the maximum in Equa-
tion (17.8) (see Claim 14.6). Using the deﬁnition of the NDCG loss, this is

242

equivalent to solving the problem

argmin

v∈V

(αivi + βi D(vi)),

where αi = −(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) and βi = yi/G(y, y). We can think of this problem a little
bit diﬀerently by deﬁning a matrix A ∈ Rr,r where

Ai,j = jαi + D(j) βi.

Now, let us think about each j as a “worker,” each i as a “task,” and Ai,j as
the cost of assigning task i to worker j. With this view, the problem of ﬁnding
v becomes the problem of ﬁnding an assignment of the tasks to workers of
minimal cost. This problem is called “the assignment problem” and can be solved
eﬃciently. One particular algorithm is the “Hungarian method” (Kuhn 1955).
Another way to solve the assignment problem is using linear programming. To
do so, let us ﬁrst write the assignment problem as

A matrix B that satisﬁes the constraints in the preceding optimization problem
is called a permutation matrix. This is because the constraints guarantee that
there is at most a single entry of each row that equals 1 and a single entry of each
column that equals 1. Therefore, the matrix B corresponds to the permutation
v ∈ V deﬁned by vi = j for the single index j that satisﬁes Bi,j = 1.
The preceding optimization is still not a linear program because of the com-
binatorial constraint Bi,j ∈ {0, 1}. However, as it turns out, this constraint is
redundant – if we solve the optimization problem while simply omitting the
combinatorial constraint, then we are still guaranteed that there is an optimal
solution that will satisfy this constraint. This is formalized later.

The following claim states that every doubly stochastic matrix is a convex

combination of permutation matrices.

claim 17.3 ((Birkhoﬀ 1946, Von Neumann 1953)) The set of doubly stochastic
matrices in Rr,r is the convex hull of the set of permutation matrices in Rr,r.

On the basis of the claim, we easily obtain the following:

lemma 17.4 There exists an optimal solution of Equation (17.10) that is also
an optimal solution of Equation (17.9).

write B = (cid:80)
(cid:80)

Proof Let B be a solution of Equation (17.10). Then, by Claim 17.3, we can
i γiCi, where each Ci is a permutation matrix, each γi > 0, and
i γi = 1. Since all the Ci are also doubly stochastic, we clearly have that
(cid:104)A, B(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)A, Ci(cid:105) for every i. We claim that there is some i for which (cid:104)A, B(cid:105) =
(cid:104)A, Ci(cid:105). This must be true since otherwise, if for every i (cid:104)A, B(cid:105) < (cid:104)A, Ci(cid:105), we
would have that
(cid:104)A, B(cid:105) =

γi(cid:104)A, B(cid:105) = (cid:104)A, B(cid:105),

which cannot hold. We have thus shown that some permutation matrix, Ci,
satisﬁes (cid:104)A, B(cid:105) = (cid:104)A, Ci(cid:105). But, since for every other permutation matrix C we
have (cid:104)A, B(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)A, C(cid:105) we conclude that Ci is an optimal solution of both Equa-
tion (17.9) and Equation (17.10).

17.5

Bipartite Ranking and Multivariate Performance Measures

In the previous section we described the problem of ranking. We used a vector
y ∈ Rr for representing an order over the elements x1, . . . , xr. If all elements in y
are diﬀerent from each other, then y speciﬁes a full order over [r]. However, if two
elements of y attain the same value, yi = yj for i (cid:54)= j, then y can only specify a
partial order over [r]. In such a case, we say that xi and xj are of equal relevance
according to y. In the extreme case, y ∈ {±1}r, which means that each xi is
either relevant or nonrelevant. This setting is often called “bipartite ranking.” For
example, in the fraud detection application mentioned in the previous section,
each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent (yi = 1) or benign (yi = −1).

Seemingly, we can solve the bipartite ranking problem by learning a binary
classiﬁer, applying it on each instance, and putting the positive ones at the top
of the ranked list. However, this may lead to poor results as the goal of a binary
learner is usually to minimize the zero-one loss (or some surrogate of it), while the
goal of a ranker might be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. To illustrate this, consider again
the problem of fraud detection. Usually, most of the transactions are benign (say
99.9%). Therefore, a binary classiﬁer that predicts “benign” on all transactions
will have a zero-one error of 0.1%. While this is a very small number, the resulting
predictor is meaningless for the fraud detection application. The crux of the

244

Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex Prediction Problems

problem stems from the inadequacy of the zero-one loss for what we are really
interested in. A more adequate performance measure should take into account
the predictions over the entire set of instances. For example, in the previous
section we have deﬁned the NDCG loss, which emphasizes the correctness of the
top-ranked items. In this section we describe additional loss functions that are
speciﬁcally adequate for bipartite ranking problems.

As in the previous section, we are given a sequence of instances, ¯x = (x1, . . . , xr),
and we predict a ranking vector y(cid:48) ∈ Rr. The feedback vector is y ∈ {±1}r. We
deﬁne a loss that depends on y(cid:48) and y and depends on a threshold θ ∈ R. This
threshold transforms the vector y(cid:48) ∈ Rr into the vector (sign(y(cid:48)
r−
θ)) ∈ {±1}r. Usually, the value of θ is set to be 0. However, as we will see, we
sometimes set θ while taking into account additional constraints on the problem.
The loss functions we deﬁne in the following depend on the following 4 num-

i−θ), . . . , sign(y(cid:48)

bers:

True positives: a = |{i : yi = +1 ∧ sign(y(cid:48)
False positives: b = |{i : yi = −1 ∧ sign(y(cid:48)
False negatives: c = |{i : yi = +1 ∧ sign(y(cid:48)
True negatives: d = |{i : yi = −1 ∧ sign(y(cid:48)

i − θ) = +1}|
i − θ) = +1}|
i − θ) = −1}|
i − θ) = −1}|

(17.11)

The recall (a.k.a. sensitivity) of a prediction vector is the fraction of true
a
a+c . The precision is the fraction of correct
a
a+b . The speciﬁcity

positives y(cid:48) “catches,” namely,
predictions among the positive labels we predict, namely,
is the fraction of true negatives that our predictor “catches,” namely,

d
d+b .

(cid:17)

Note that as we decrease θ the recall increases (attaining the value 1 when
θ = −∞). On the other hand, the precision and the speciﬁcity usually decrease
as we decrease θ. Therefore, there is a tradeoﬀ between precision and recall, and
we can control it by changing θ. The loss functions deﬁned in the following use
various techniques for combining both the precision and recall.
• Averaging sensitivity and speciﬁcity: This measure is the average of the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity, namely, 1
. This is also the accuracy
2
on positive examples averaged with the accuracy on negative examples.
Here, we set θ = 0 and the corresponding loss function is ∆(y(cid:48), y) =
1 − 1

Recall

• F1-score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall:
. Its maximal value (of 1) is obtained when both precision
Precision + 1
and recall are 1, and its minimal value (of 0) is obtained whenever one of
them is 0 (even if the other one is 1). The F1 score can be written using
the numbers a, b, c as follows; F1 = 2a
2a+b+c . Again, we set θ = 0, and the
loss function becomes ∆(y(cid:48), y) = 1 − F1.
• Fβ-score: It is like F1 score, but we attach β2 times more importance to
. It can also be written as

recall than to precision, that is,

(1+β2)a+b+β2c . Again, we set θ = 0, and the loss function becomes
• Recall at k: We measure the recall while the prediction must contain at most
k positive labels. That is, we should set θ so that a + b ≤ k. This is conve-
nient, for example, in the application of a fraud detection system, where a
bank employee can only handle a small number of suspicious transactions.
• Precision at k: We measure the precision while the prediction must contain

at least k positive labels. That is, we should set θ so that a + b ≥ k.

The measures deﬁned previously are often referred to as multivariate perfor-
mance measures. Note that these measures are highly diﬀerent from the average
a+b+c+d . In the aforemen-
zero-one loss, which in the preceding notation equals
tioned example of fraud detection, when 99.9% of the examples are negatively
labeled, the zero-one loss of predicting that all the examples are negatives is
0.1%. In contrast, the recall of such prediction is 0 and hence the F1 score is also
0, which means that the corresponding loss will be 1.

17.5.1

Linear Predictors for Bipartite Ranking

We next describe how to train linear predictors for bipartite ranking. As in the
previous section, a linear predictor for ranking is deﬁned to be

hw(¯x) = ((cid:104)w, x1(cid:105), . . . ,(cid:104)w, xr(cid:105)).

The corresponding loss function is one of the multivariate performance measures
described before. The loss function depends on y(cid:48) = hw(¯x) via the binary vector
it induces, which we denote by
b(y(cid:48)) = (sign(y(cid:48)

1 − θ), . . . , sign(y(cid:48)

r − θ)) ∈ {±1}r.

(17.12)

As in the previous section, to facilitate an eﬃcient algorithm we derive a convex
surrogate loss function on ∆. The derivation is similar to the derivation of the
generalized hinge loss for the NDCG ranking loss, as described in the previous
section.

Our ﬁrst observation is that for all the values of θ deﬁned before, there is some

V ⊆ {±1}r such that b(y(cid:48)) can be rewritten as

r(cid:88)

i=1

b(y(cid:48)) = argmax

v∈V

viy(cid:48)
i.

(17.13)

This is clearly true for the case θ = 0 if we choose V = {±1}r. The two measures
for which θ is not taken to be 0 are precision at k and recall at k. For precision
at k we can take V to be the set V≥k, containing all vectors in {±1}r whose
number of ones is at least k. For recall at k, we can take V to be V≤k, which is
deﬁned analogously. See Exercise 5.

246

Multiclass, Ranking, and Complex Prediction Problems

Once we have deﬁned b as in Equation (17.13), we can easily derive a convex

surrogate loss as follows. Assuming that y ∈ V , we have that

∆(hw(¯x), y) = ∆(b(hw(¯x)), y)

(17.14)

The right-hand side is a convex function with respect to w.

We can now solve the learning problem using SGD as described in Section 17.2.5.

The main computational bottleneck is calculating a subgradient of the loss func-
tion, which is equivalent to ﬁnding v that achieves the maximum in Equa-
tion (17.14) (see Claim 14.6).

In the following we describe how to ﬁnd this maximizer eﬃciently for any
performance measure that can be written as a function of the numbers a, b, c, d
given in Equation (17.11), and for which the set V contains all elements in {±1}r
for which the values of a, b satisfy some constraints. For example, for “recall at
k” the set V is all vectors for which a + b ≤ k.
The idea is as follows. For any a, b ∈ [r], let

¯Ya,b = {v :

|{i : vi = 1 ∧ yi = 1}| = a ∧ |{i : vi = 1 ∧ yi = −1}| = b} .

Any vector v ∈ V falls into ¯Ya,b for some a, b ∈ [r]. Furthermore, if ¯Ya,b ∩ V

within each ¯Ya,b that has a nonempty intersection with V separately, and then
take the optimal value. The key observation is that once we are searching only
within ¯Ya,b, the value of ∆ is ﬁxed so we only need to maximize the expression

Suppose the examples are sorted so that (cid:104)w, x1(cid:105) ≥ ··· ≥ (cid:104)w, xr(cid:105). Then, it is
easy to verify that we would like to set vi to be positive for the smallest indices
i. Doing this, with the constraint on a, b, amounts to setting vi = 1 for the a
top ranked positive examples and for the b top-ranked negative examples. This
yields the following procedure.

Summary

Many real world supervised learning problems can be cast as learning a multiclass
predictor. We started the chapter by introducing reductions of multiclass learning
to binary learning. We then described and analyzed the family of linear predictors
for multiclass learning. We have shown how this family can be used even if the
number of classes is extremely large, as long as we have an adequate structure
on the problem. Finally, we have described ranking problems. In Chapter 29 we
study the sample complexity of multiclass learning in more detail.

Bibliographic Remarks

The One-versus-All and All-Pairs approach reductions have been uniﬁed un-
der the framework of Error Correction Output Codes (ECOC) (Dietterich &
Bakiri 1995, Allwein, Schapire & Singer 2000). There are also other types of re-
ductions such as tree-based classiﬁers (see, for example, Beygelzimer, Langford
& Ravikumar (2007)). The limitations of reduction techniques have been studied

in (Daniely et al. 2011, Daniely, Sabato & Shwartz 2012). See also Chapter 29,
in which we analyze the sample complexity of multiclass learning.

Direct approaches to multiclass learning with linear predictors have been stud-
ied in (Vapnik 1998, Weston & Watkins 1999, Crammer & Singer 2001). In par-
ticular, the multivector construction is due to Crammer & Singer (2001).

Collins (2000) has shown how to apply the Perceptron algorithm for structured
output problems. See also Collins (2002). A related approach is discriminative
learning of conditional random ﬁelds; see Laﬀerty, McCallum & Pereira (2001).
Structured output SVM has been studied in (Weston, Chapelle, Vapnik, Elisseeﬀ
& Sch¨olkopf 2002, Taskar, Guestrin & Koller 2003, Tsochantaridis, Hofmann,
Joachims & Altun 2004).

The dynamic procedure we have presented for calculating the prediction hw(x)
in the structured output section is similar to the forward-backward variables
calculated by the Viterbi procedure in HMMs (see, for instance, (Rabiner &
Juang 1986)). More generally, solving the maximization problem in structured
output is closely related to the problem of inference in graphical models (see, for
example, Koller & Friedman (2009)).

Chapelle, Le & Smola (2007) proposed to learn a ranking function with respect
to the NDCG loss using ideas from structured output learning. They also ob-
served that the maximization problem in the deﬁnition of the generalized hinge
loss is equivalent to the assignment problem.

Agarwal & Roth (2005) analyzed the sample complexity of bipartite ranking.
Joachims (2005) studied the applicability of structured output SVM to bipartite
ranking with multivariate performance measures.

18 Decision Trees

A decision tree is a predictor, h : X → Y, that predicts the label associated with
an instance x by traveling from a root node of a tree to a leaf. For simplicity
we focus on the binary classiﬁcation setting, namely, Y = {0, 1}, but decision
trees can be applied for other prediction problems as well. At each node on the
root-to-leaf path, the successor child is chosen on the basis of a splitting of the
input space. Usually, the splitting is based on one of the features of x or on a
predeﬁned set of splitting rules. A leaf contains a speciﬁc label. An example of
a decision tree for the papayas example (described in Chapter 2) is given in the
following:

Color?

other

pale green to pale yellow

not-tasty

Softness?

other

gives slightly to palm pressure

not-tasty

tasty

To check if a given papaya is tasty or not, the decision tree ﬁrst examines
the color of the Papaya. If this color is not in the range pale green to pale
yellow, then the tree immediately predicts that the papaya is not tasty without
additional tests. Otherwise, the tree turns to examine the softness of the papaya.
If the softness level of the papaya is such that it gives slightly to palm pressure,
the decision tree predicts that the papaya is tasty. Otherwise, the prediction is
“not-tasty.” The preceding example underscores one of the main advantages of
decision trees – the resulting classiﬁer is very simple to understand and interpret.

18.1 Sample Complexity

251

18.1

Sample Complexity

A popular splitting rule at internal nodes of the tree is based on thresholding the
value of a single feature. That is, we move to the right or left child of the node on
the basis of 1[xi<θ], where i ∈ [d] is the index of the relevant feature and θ ∈ R
is the threshold. In such cases, we can think of a decision tree as a splitting of
the instance space, X = Rd, into cells, where each leaf of the tree corresponds
to one cell. It follows that a tree with k leaves can shatter a set of k instances.
Hence, if we allow decision trees of arbitrary size, we obtain a hypothesis class
of inﬁnite VC dimension. Such an approach can easily lead to overﬁtting.

To avoid overﬁtting, we can rely on the minimum description length (MDL)
principle described in Chapter 7, and aim at learning a decision tree that on one
hand ﬁts the data well while on the other hand is not too large.

For simplicity, we will assume that X = {0, 1}d. In other words, each instance
is a vector of d bits. In that case, thresholding the value of a single feature
corresponds to a splitting rule of the form 1[xi=1] for some i = [d]. For instance,
we can model the “papaya decision tree” earlier by assuming that a papaya is
parameterized by a two-dimensional bit vector x ∈ {0, 1}2, where the bit x1
represents whether the color is pale green to pale yellow or not, and the bit x2
represents whether the softness is gives slightly to palm pressure or not. With
this representation, the node Color? can be replaced with 1[x1=1], and the node
Softness? can be replaced with 1[x2=1]. While this is a big simpliﬁcation, the
algorithms and analysis we provide in the following can be extended to more
general cases.

With the aforementioned simplifying assumption, the hypothesis class becomes
ﬁnite, but is still very large. In particular, any classiﬁer from {0, 1}d to {0, 1}
can be represented by a decision tree with 2d leaves and depth of d + 1 (see
Exercise 1). Therefore, the VC dimension of the class is 2d, which means that
the number of examples we need to PAC learn the hypothesis class grows with
2d. Unless d is very small, this is a huge number of examples.

To overcome this obstacle, we rely on the MDL scheme described in Chapter 7.
The underlying prior knowledge is that we should prefer smaller trees over larger
trees. To formalize this intuition, we ﬁrst need to deﬁne a description language
for decision trees, which is preﬁx free and requires fewer bits for smaller decision
trees. Here is one possible way: A tree with n nodes will be described in n + 1
blocks, each of size log2(d + 3) bits. The ﬁrst n blocks encode the nodes of the
tree, in a depth-ﬁrst order (preorder), and the last block marks the end of the
code. Each block indicates whether the current node is:

• An internal node of the form 1[xi=1] for some i ∈ [d]
• A leaf whose value is 1
• A leaf whose value is 0
• End of the code

252

Decision Trees

Overall, there are d + 3 options, hence we need log2(d + 3) bits to describe each
block.

Assuming each internal node has two children,1 it is not hard to show that
this is a preﬁx-free encoding of the tree, and that the description length of a tree
with n nodes is (n + 1) log2(d + 3).
By Theorem 7.7 we have that with probability of at least 1 − δ over a sample
of size m, for every n and every decision tree h ∈ H with n nodes it holds that

(cid:114)

LD(h) ≤ LS(h) +

(n + 1) log2(d + 3) + log(2/δ)

2m

.

(18.1)

This bound performs a tradeoﬀ: on the one hand, we expect larger, more complex
decision trees to have a smaller training risk, LS(h), but the respective value of
n will be larger. On the other hand, smaller decision trees will have a smaller
value of n, but LS(h) might be larger. Our hope (or prior knowledge) is that we
can ﬁnd a decision tree with both low empirical risk, LS(h), and a number of
nodes n not too high. Our bound indicates that such a tree will have low true
risk, LD(h).

18.2

Decision Tree Algorithms

The bound on LD(h) given in Equation (18.1) suggests a learning rule for decision
trees – search for a tree that minimizes the right-hand side of Equation (18.1).
Unfortunately, it turns out that solving this problem is computationally hard.2
Consequently, practical decision tree learning algorithms are based on heuristics
such as a greedy approach, where the tree is constructed gradually, and locally
optimal decisions are made at the construction of each node. Such algorithms
cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree but tend to work
reasonably well in practice.

A general framework for growing a decision tree is as follows. We start with
a tree with a single leaf (the root) and assign this leaf a label according to a
majority vote among all labels over the training set. We now perform a series of
iterations. On each iteration, we examine the eﬀect of splitting a single leaf. We
deﬁne some “gain” measure that quantiﬁes the improvement due to this split.
Then, among all possible splits, we either choose the one that maximizes the
gain and perform it, or choose not to split the leaf at all.

In the following we provide a possible implementation. It is based on a popular
decision tree algorithm known as “ID3” (short for “Iterative Dichotomizer 3”).
We describe the algorithm for the case of binary features, namely, X = {0, 1}d,

1 We may assume this without loss of generality, because if a decision node has only one

child, we can replace the node by its child without aﬀecting the predictions of the decision
tree.
2 More precisely, if NP(cid:54)=P then no algorithm can solve Equation (18.1) in time polynomial

in n, d, and m.

18.2 Decision Tree Algorithms

253

and therefore all splitting rules are of the form 1[xi=1] for some feature i ∈ [d].
We discuss the case of real valued features in Section 18.2.3.

The algorithm works by recursive calls, with the initial call being ID3(S, [d]),
and returns a decision tree. In the pseudocode that follows, we use a call to a
procedure Gain(S, i), which receives a training set S and an index i and evaluates
the gain of a split of the tree according to the ith feature. We describe several
gain measures in Section 18.2.1.

ID3(S, A)

Input: training set S, feature subset A ⊆ [d]
if all examples in S are labeled by 1, return a leaf 1
if all examples in S are labeled by 0, return a leaf 0
if A = ∅, return a leaf whose value = majority of labels in S
else :

Let j = argmaxi∈A Gain(S, i)
if all examples in S have the same label

Return a leaf whose value = majority of labels in S
else
Let T1 be the tree returned by ID3({(x, y) ∈ S : xj = 1}, A \ {j}).
Let T2 be the tree returned by ID3({(x, y) ∈ S : xj = 0}, A \ {j}).
Return the tree:

xj = 1?

T2

T1

18.2.1

Implementations of the Gain Measure

Diﬀerent algorithms use diﬀerent implementations of Gain(S, i). Here we present
three. We use the notation PS[F ] to denote the probability that an event holds
with respect to the uniform distribution over S.
Train Error: The simplest deﬁnition of gain is the decrease in training error.
Formally, let C(a) = min{a, 1−a}. Note that the training error before splitting on
feature i is C(PS[y = 1]), since we took a majority vote among labels. Similarly,
the error after splitting on feature i is

P
S

[xi = 1] C(P

[y = 1|xi = 1]) + P

[xi = 0]C(P

[y = 1|xi = 0]).

Therefore, we can deﬁne Gain to be the diﬀerence between the two, namely,

254

Decision Trees

Information Gain: Another popular gain measure that is used in the ID3
and C4.5 algorithms of Quinlan (1993) is the information gain. The information
gain is the diﬀerence between the entropy of the label before and after the split,
and is achieved by replacing the function C in the previous expression by the
entropy function,

C(a) = −a log(a) − (1 − a) log(1 − a).

Gini Index: Yet another deﬁnition of a gain, which is used by the CART

algorithm of Breiman, Friedman, Olshen & Stone (1984), is the Gini index,

C(a) = 2a(1 − a).

Both the information gain and the Gini index are smooth and concave upper
bounds of the train error. These properties can be advantageous in some situa-
tions (see, for example, Kearns & Mansour (1996)).

18.2.2

Pruning

The ID3 algorithm described previously still suﬀers from a big problem: The
returned tree will usually be very large. Such trees may have low empirical risk,
but their true risk will tend to be high – both according to our theoretical
analysis, and in practice. One solution is to limit the number of iterations of ID3,
leading to a tree with a bounded number of nodes. Another common solution is
to prune the tree after it is built, hoping to reduce it to a much smaller tree,
but still with a similar empirical error. Theoretically, according to the bound in
Equation (18.1), if we can make n much smaller without increasing LS(h) by
much, we are likely to get a decision tree with a smaller true risk.

Usually, the pruning is performed by a bottom-up walk on the tree. Each node
might be replaced with one of its subtrees or with a leaf, based on some bound
or estimate of LD(h) (for example, the bound in Equation (18.1)). A pseudocode
of a common template is given in the following.

Generic Tree Pruning Procedure

input:

function f (T, m) (bound/estimate for the generalization error

of a decision tree T , based on a sample of size m),

foreach node j in a bottom-up walk on T (from leaves to root):

ﬁnd T (cid:48) which minimizes f (T (cid:48), m), where T (cid:48) is any of the following:

the current tree after replacing node j with a leaf 1.
the current tree after replacing node j with a leaf 0.
the current tree after replacing node j with its left subtree.
the current tree after replacing node j with its right subtree.
the current tree.

let T := T (cid:48).

18.3 Random Forests

18.2.3

Threshold-Based Splitting Rules for Real-Valued Features

In the previous section we have described an algorithm for growing a decision
tree assuming that the features are binary and the splitting rules are of the
form 1[xi=1]. We now extend this result to the case of real-valued features and
threshold-based splitting rules, namely, 1[xi<θ]. Such splitting rules yield decision
stumps, and we have studied them in Chapter 10.

The basic idea is to reduce the problem to the case of binary features as
follows. Let x1, . . . , xm be the instances of the training set. For each real-valued
feature i, sort the instances so that x1,i ≤ ··· ≤ xm,i. Deﬁne a set of thresholds
θ0,i, . . . , θm+1,i such that θj,i ∈ (xj,i, xj+1,i) (where we use the convention x0,i =
−∞ and xm+1,i = ∞). Finally, for each i and j we deﬁne the binary feature
1[xi<θj,i]. Once we have constructed these binary features, we can run the ID3
procedure described in the previous section. It is easy to verify that for any
decision tree with threshold-based splitting rules over the original real-valued
features there exists a decision tree over the constructed binary features with
the same training error and the same number of nodes.

If the original number of real-valued features is d and the number of examples
is m, then the number of constructed binary features becomes dm. Calculating
the Gain of each feature might therefore take O(dm2) operations. However, using
a more clever implementation, the runtime can be reduced to O(dm log(m)). The
idea is similar to the implementation of ERM for decision stumps as described
in Section 10.1.1.

18.3

Random Forests

As mentioned before, the class of decision trees of arbitrary size has inﬁnite VC
dimension. We therefore restricted the size of the decision tree. Another way
to reduce the danger of overﬁtting is by constructing an ensemble of trees. In
particular, in the following we describe the method of random forests, introduced
by Breiman (2001).

A random forest is a classiﬁer consisting of a collection of decision trees, where
each tree is constructed by applying an algorithm A on the training set S and
an additional random vector, θ, where θ is sampled i.i.d. from some distribution.
The prediction of the random forest is obtained by a majority vote over the
predictions of the individual trees.

To specify a particular random forest, we need to deﬁne the algorithm A and
the distribution over θ. There are many ways to do this and here we describe one
particular option. We generate θ as follows. First, we take a random subsample
from S with replacements; namely, we sample a new training set S(cid:48) of size m(cid:48)
using the uniform distribution over S. Second, we construct a sequence I1, I2, . . .,
where each It is a subset of [d] of size k, which is generated by sampling uniformly
at random elements from [d]. All these random variables form the vector θ. Then,

256

Decision Trees

the algorithm A grows a decision tree (e.g., using the ID3 algorithm) based on
the sample S(cid:48), where at each splitting stage of the algorithm, the algorithm is
restricted to choosing a feature that maximizes Gain from the set It. Intuitively,
if k is small, this restriction may prevent overﬁtting.

18.4

Summary

Decision trees are very intuitive predictors. Typically, if a human programmer
creates a predictor it will look like a decision tree. We have shown that the VC
dimension of decision trees with k leaves is k and proposed the MDL paradigm
for learning decision trees. The main problem with decision trees is that they
are computationally hard to learn; therefore we described several heuristic pro-
cedures for training them.

18.5

Bibliographic Remarks

Many algorithms for learning decision trees (such as ID3 and C4.5) have been
derived by Quinlan (1986). The CART algorithm is due to Breiman et al. (1984).
Random forests were introduced by Breiman (2001). For additional reading we
refer the reader to (Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman 2001, Rokach 2007).

The proof of the hardness of training decision trees is given in Hyaﬁl & Rivest

(1976).

1. Suppose we run the ID3 algorithm up to depth 2 (namely, we pick the root
node and its children according to the algorithm, but instead of keeping
on with the recursion, we stop and pick leaves according to the majority
label in each subtree). Assume that the subroutine used to measure the
quality of each feature is based on the entropy function (so we measure the
information gain), and that if two features get the same score, one of them
is picked arbitrarily. Show that the training error of the resulting decision
tree is at least 1/4.

2. Find a decision tree of depth 2 that attains zero training error.

19 Nearest Neighbor

Nearest Neighbor algorithms are among the simplest of all machine learning
algorithms. The idea is to memorize the training set and then to predict the
label of any new instance on the basis of the labels of its closest neighbors in
the training set. The rationale behind such a method is based on the assumption
that the features that are used to describe the domain points are relevant to
their labelings in a way that makes close-by points likely to have the same label.
Furthermore, in some situations, even when the training set is immense, ﬁnding
a nearest neighbor can be done extremely fast (for example, when the training
set is the entire Web and distances are based on links).

Note that, in contrast with the algorithmic paradigms that we have discussed
so far, like ERM, SRM, MDL, or RLM, that are determined by some hypothesis
class, H, the Nearest Neighbor method ﬁgures out a label on any test point
without searching for a predictor within some predeﬁned class of functions.

In this chapter we describe Nearest Neighbor methods for classiﬁcation and
regression problems. We analyze their performance for the simple case of binary
classiﬁcation and discuss the eﬃciency of implementing these methods.

19.1

k Nearest Neighbors

Throughout the entire chapter we assume that our instance domain, X , is en-
dowed with a metric function ρ. That is, ρ : X ×X → R is a function that returns
the distance between any two elements of X . For example, if X = Rd then ρ can
be the Euclidean distance, ρ(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107) =

Let S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym) be a sequence of training examples. For each
x ∈ X , let π1(x), . . . , πm(x) be a reordering of {1, . . . , m} according to their
distance to x, ρ(x, xi). That is, for all i < m,

ρ(x, xπi(x)) ≤ ρ(x, xπi+1(x)).

For a number k, the k-NN rule for binary classiﬁcation is deﬁned as follows:

input: a training sample S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)
output: for every point x ∈ X ,
return the majority label among {yπi(x) : i ≤ k}

When k = 1, we have the 1-NN rule:

hS(x) = yπ1(x).

A geometric illustration of the 1-NN rule is given in Figure 19.1.

For regression problems, namely, Y = R, one can deﬁne the prediction to be
the average target of the k nearest neighbors. That is, hS(x) = 1
i=1 yπi(x).
More generally, for some function φ : (X ×Y)k → Y, the k-NN rule with respect
k
to φ is:

hS(x) = φ(cid:0)(xπ1(x), yπ1(x)), . . . , (xπk(x), yπk(x))(cid:1) .

(cid:80)k

It is easy to verify that we can cast the prediction by majority of labels (for
classiﬁcation) or by the averaged target (for regression) as in Equation (19.1) by
an appropriate choice of φ. The generality can lead to other rules; for example, if
Y = R, we can take a weighted average of the targets according to the distance
from x:

Analysis

Since the NN rules are such natural learning methods, their generalization prop-
erties have been extensively studied. Most previous results are asymptotic con-
sistency results, analyzing the performance of NN rules when the sample size, m,

260

Nearest Neighbor

goes to inﬁnity, and the rate of convergence depends on the underlying distribu-
tion. As we have argued in Section 7.4, this type of analysis is not satisfactory.
One would like to learn from ﬁnite training samples and to understand the gen-
eralization performance as a function of the size of such ﬁnite training sets and
clear prior assumptions on the data distribution. We therefore provide a ﬁnite-
sample analysis of the 1-NN rule, showing how the error decreases as a function
of m and how it depends on properties of the distribution. We will also explain
how the analysis can be generalized to k-NN rules for arbitrary values of k. In
particular, the analysis speciﬁes the number of examples required to achieve a
true error of 2LD(h(cid:63)) + , where h(cid:63) is the Bayes optimal hypothesis, assuming
that the labeling rule is “well behaved” (in a sense we will deﬁne later).

19.2.1

A Generalization Bound for the 1-NN Rule

We now analyze the true error of the 1-NN rule for binary classiﬁcation with
the 0-1 loss, namely, Y = {0, 1} and (cid:96)(h, (x, y)) = 1[h(x)(cid:54)=y]. We also assume
throughout the analysis that X = [0, 1]d and ρ is the Euclidean distance.
We start by introducing some notation. Let D be a distribution over X × Y.
Let DX denote the induced marginal distribution over X and let η : Rd → R be
the conditional probability1 over the labels, that is,

η(x) = P[y = 1|x].

Recall that the Bayes optimal rule (that is, the hypothesis that minimizes LD(h)
over all functions) is

h(cid:63)(x) = 1[η(x)>1/2].

We assume that the conditional probability function η is c-Lipschitz for some
|η(x)− η(x(cid:48))| ≤ c(cid:107)x− x(cid:48)(cid:107). In other words, this
c > 0: Namely, for all x, x(cid:48) ∈ X ,
assumption means that if two vectors are close to each other then their labels
are likely to be the same.

The following lemma applies the Lipschitzness of the conditional probability
function to upper bound the true error of the 1-NN rule as a function of the
expected distance between each test instance and its nearest neighbor in the
training set.
lemma 19.1 Let X = [0, 1]d,Y = {0, 1}, and D be a distribution over X × Y
for which the conditional probability function, η, is a c-Lipschitz function. Let
S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym) be an i.i.d. sample and let hS be its corresponding
1-NN hypothesis. Let h(cid:63) be the Bayes optimal rule for η. Then,

Proof Since LD(hS) = E(x,y)∼D[1[hS (x)(cid:54)=y]], we obtain that ES[LD(hS)] is the
probability to sample a training set S and an additional example (x, y), such
that the label of π1(x) is diﬀerent from y. In other words, we can ﬁrst sample
m unlabeled examples, Sx = (x1, . . . , xm), according to DX , and an additional
unlabeled example, x ∼ DX , then ﬁnd π1(x) to be the nearest neighbor of x in
Sx, and ﬁnally sample y ∼ η(x) and yπ1(x) ∼ η(π1(x)). It follows that

We next upper bound Py∼η(x),y(cid:48)∼η(x(cid:48))[y (cid:54)= y(cid:48)] for any two domain points x, x(cid:48):

P

y∼η(x),y(cid:48)∼η(x(cid:48))

= (η(x) − η(x) + η(x(cid:48)))(1 − η(x))
+ (1 − η(x) + η(x) − η(x(cid:48)))η(x)

= 2η(x)(1 − η(x)) + (η(x) − η(x(cid:48)))(2η(x) − 1).

Using |2η(x) − 1| ≤ 1 and the assumption that η is c-Lipschitz, we obtain that
the probability is at most:

P

y∼η(x),y(cid:48)∼η(x(cid:48))

[y (cid:54)= y(cid:48)] ≤ 2η(x)(1 − η(x)) + c(cid:107)x − x(cid:48)(cid:107).

Plugging this into Equation (19.2) we conclude that

Combining the preceding two inequalities concludes our proof.

The next step is to bound the expected distance between a random x and its
closest element in S. We ﬁrst need the following general probability lemma. The
lemma bounds the probability weight of subsets that are not hit by a random
sample, as a function of the size of that sample.
lemma 19.2 Let C1, . . . , Cr be a collection of subsets of some domain set, X .
Let S be a sequence of m points sampled i.i.d. according to some probability

The theorem implies that if we ﬁrst ﬁx the data-generating distribution and
then let m go to inﬁnity, then the error of the 1-NN rule converges to twice the
Bayes error. The analysis can be generalized to larger values of k, showing that

the expected error of the k-NN rule converges to (1 +(cid:112)8/k) times the error of

the Bayes classiﬁer. This is formalized in Theorem 19.5, whose proof is left as a
guided exercise.

19.2.2

The “Curse of Dimensionality”

The upper bound given in Theorem 19.3 grows with c (the Lipschitz coeﬃcient
of η) and with d, the Euclidean dimension of the domain set X . In fact, it is easy
to see that a necessary condition for the last term in Theorem 19.3 to be smaller
than  is that m ≥ (4 c
d/)d+1. That is, the size of the training set should
increase exponentially with the dimension. The following theorem tells us that
this is not just an artifact of our upper bound, but, for some distributions, this
amount of examples is indeed necessary for learning with the NN rule.

√

theorem 19.4 For any c > 1, and every learning rule, L, there exists a
distribution over [0, 1]d ×{0, 1}, such that η(x) is c-Lipschitz, the Bayes error of
the distribution is 0, but for sample sizes m ≤ (c + 1)d/2, the true error of the
rule L is greater than 1/4.

Proof Fix any values of c and d. Let Gd
c be the grid on [0, 1]d with distance of
1/c between points on the grid. That is, each point on the grid is of the form
(a1/c, . . . , ad/c) where ai is in {0, . . . , c− 1, c}. Note that, since any two distinct
C → [0, 1] is a
points on this grid are at least 1/c apart, any function η : GD
c-Lipschitz function. It follows that the set of all c-Lipschitz functions over Gd
c
contains the set of all binary valued functions over that domain. We can therefore
invoke the No-Free-Lunch result (Theorem 5.1) to obtain a lower bound on the
needed sample sizes for learning that class. The number of points on the grid is
(c + 1)d; hence, if m < (c + 1)d/2, Theorem 5.1 implies the lower bound we are
after.

264

Nearest Neighbor

The exponential dependence on the dimension is known as the curse of di-
mensionality. As we saw, the 1-NN rule might fail if the number of examples is
smaller than Ω((c+1)d). Therefore, while the 1-NN rule does not restrict itself to
a predeﬁned set of hypotheses, it still relies on some prior knowledge – its success
depends on the assumption that the dimension and the Lipschitz constant of the
underlying distribution, η, are not too high.

19.3

Eﬃcient Implementation*

Nearest Neighbor is a learning-by-memorization type of rule. It requires the
entire training data set to be stored, and at test time, we need to scan the entire
data set in order to ﬁnd the neighbors. The time of applying the NN rule is
therefore Θ(d m). This leads to expensive computation at test time.

When d is small, several results from the ﬁeld of computational geometry have
proposed data structures that enable to apply the NN rule in time o(dO(1) log(m)).
However, the space required by these data structures is roughly mO(d), which
makes these methods impractical for larger values of d.

To overcome this problem, it was suggested to improve the search method by
allowing an approximate search. Formally, an r-approximate search procedure is
guaranteed to retrieve a point within distance of at most r times the distance
to the nearest neighbor. Three popular approximate algorithms for NN are the
kd-tree, balltrees, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). We refer the reader, for
example, to (Shakhnarovich, Darrell & Indyk 2006).

19.4

Summary

The k-NN rule is a very simple learning algorithm that relies on the assumption
that “things that look alike must be alike.” We formalized this intuition using
the Lipschitzness of the conditional probability. We have shown that with a suf-
ﬁciently large training set, the risk of the 1-NN is upper bounded by twice the
risk of the Bayes optimal rule. We have also derived a lower bound that shows
the “curse of dimensionality” – the required sample size might increase expo-
nentially with the dimension. As a result, NN is usually performed in practice
after a dimensionality reduction preprocessing step. We discuss dimensionality
reduction techniques later on in Chapter 23.

19.5

Bibliographic Remarks

Cover & Hart (1967) gave the ﬁrst analysis of 1-NN, showing that its risk con-
verges to twice the Bayes optimal error under mild conditions. Following a lemma
due to Stone (1977), Devroye & Gy¨orﬁ (1985) have shown that the k-NN rule

19.6 Exercises

265

is consistent (with respect to the hypothesis class of all functions from Rd to
{0, 1}). A good presentation of the analysis is given in the book of Devroye et al.
(1996). Here, we give a ﬁnite sample guarantee that explicitly underscores the
prior assumption on the distribution. See Section 7.4 for a discussion on con-
sistency results. Finally, Gottlieb, Kontorovich & Krauthgamer (2010) derived
another ﬁnite sample bound for NN that is more similar to VC bounds.

20 Neural Networks

An artiﬁcial neural network is a model of computation inspired by the structure
of neural networks in the brain. In simpliﬁed models of the brain, it consists of
a large number of basic computing devices (neurons) that are connected to each
other in a complex communication network, through which the brain is able to
carry out highly complex computations. Artiﬁcial neural networks are formal
computation constructs that are modeled after this computation paradigm.

Learning with neural networks was proposed in the mid-20th century. It yields
an eﬀective learning paradigm and has recently been shown to achieve cutting-
edge performance on several learning tasks.

A neural network can be described as a directed graph whose nodes correspond
to neurons and edges correspond to links between them. Each neuron receives
as input a weighted sum of the outputs of the neurons connected to its incoming
edges. We focus on feedforward networks in which the underlying graph does not
contain cycles.

In the context of learning, we can deﬁne a hypothesis class consisting of neural
network predictors, where all the hypotheses share the underlying graph struc-
ture of the network and diﬀer in the weights over edges. As we will show in
Section 20.3, every predictor over n variables that can be implemented in time
T (n) can also be expressed as a neural network predictor of size O(T (n)2), where
the size of the network is the number of nodes in it. It follows that the family
of hypothesis classes of neural networks of polynomial size can suﬃce for all
practical learning tasks, in which our goal is to learn predictors which can be
implemented eﬃciently. Furthermore, in Section 20.4 we will show that the sam-
ple complexity of learning such hypothesis classes is also bounded in terms of the
size of the network. Hence, it seems that this is the ultimate learning paradigm
we would want to adapt, in the sense that it both has a polynomial sample com-
plexity and has the minimal approximation error among all hypothesis classes
consisting of eﬃciently implementable predictors.

The caveat is that the problem of training such hypothesis classes of neural net-
work predictors is computationally hard. This will be formalized in Section 20.5.
A widely used heuristic for training neural networks relies on the SGD frame-
work we studied in Chapter 14. There, we have shown that SGD is a successful
learner if the loss function is convex. In neural networks, the loss function is
highly nonconvex. Nevertheless, we can still implement the SGD algorithm and

hope it will ﬁnd a reasonable solution (as happens to be the case in several
practical tasks). In Section 20.6 we describe how to implement SGD for neural
networks. In particular, the most complicated operation is the calculation of the
gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the network. We
present the backpropagation algorithm that eﬃciently calculates the gradient.

20.1

Feedforward Neural Networks

The idea behind neural networks is that many neurons can be joined together
by communication links to carry out complex computations. It is common to
describe the structure of a neural network as a graph whose nodes are the neurons
and each (directed) edge in the graph links the output of some neuron to the
input of another neuron. We will restrict our attention to feedforward network
structures in which the underlying graph does not contain cycles.

A feedforward neural network is described by a directed acyclic graph, G =
(V, E), and a weight function over the edges, w : E → R. Nodes of the graph
correspond to neurons. Each single neuron is modeled as a simple scalar func-
tion, σ : R → R. We will focus on three possible functions for σ: the sign
function, σ(a) = sign(a), the threshold function, σ(a) = 1[a>0], and the sig-
moid function, σ(a) = 1/(1 + exp(−a)), which is a smooth approximation to the
threshold function. We call σ the “activation” function of the neuron. Each edge
in the graph links the output of some neuron to the input of another neuron.
The input of a neuron is obtained by taking a weighted sum of the outputs of
all the neurons connected to it, where the weighting is according to w.

To simplify the description of the calculation performed by the network, we
further assume that the network is organized in layers. That is, the set of nodes
can be decomposed into a union of (nonempty) disjoint subsets, V = ·∪T
t=0Vt,
such that every edge in E connects some node in Vt−1 to some node in Vt, for
some t ∈ [T ]. The bottom layer, V0, is called the input layer. It contains n + 1
neurons, where n is the dimensionality of the input space. For every i ∈ [n], the
output of neuron i in V0 is simply xi. The last neuron in V0 is the “constant”
neuron, which always outputs 1. We denote by vt,i the ith neuron of the tth layer
and by ot,i(x) the output of vt,i when the network is fed with the input vector x.
Therefore, for i ∈ [n] we have o0,i(x) = xi and for i = n + 1 we have o0,i(x) = 1.
We now proceed with the calculation in a layer by layer manner. Suppose we
have calculated the outputs of the neurons at layer t. Then, we can calculate
the outputs of the neurons at layer t + 1 as follows. Fix some vt+1,j ∈ Vt+1.
Let at+1,j(x) denote the input to vt+1,j when the network is fed with the input
vector x. Then,

at+1,j(x) =

w((vt,r, vt+1,j)) ot,r(x),

(cid:88)

r: (vt,r,vt+1,j )∈E

270

Neural Networks

and

ot+1,j(x) = σ (at+1,j(x)) .

That is, the input to vt+1,j is a weighted sum of the outputs of the neurons in Vt
that are connected to vt+1,j, where weighting is according to w, and the output
of vt+1,j is simply the application of the activation function σ on its input.

Layers V1, . . . , VT−1 are often called hidden layers. The top layer, VT , is called
the output layer. In simple prediction problems the output layer contains a single
neuron whose output is the output of the network.

We refer to T as the number of layers in the network (excluding V0), or the
“depth” of the network. The size of the network is |V |. The “width” of the
network is maxt |Vt|. An illustration of a layered feedforward neural network of
depth 2, size 10, and width 5, is given in the following. Note that there is a
neuron in the hidden layer that has no incoming edges. This neuron will output
the constant σ(0).

Learning Neural Networks

Once we have speciﬁed a neural network by (V, E, σ, w), we obtain a function
hV,E,σ,w : R|V0|−1 → R|VT |. Any set of such functions can serve as a hypothesis
class for learning. Usually, we deﬁne a hypothesis class of neural network predic-
tors by ﬁxing the graph (V, E) as well as the activation function σ and letting
the hypothesis class be all functions of the form hV,E,σ,w for some w : E → R.
The triplet (V, E, σ) is often called the architecture of the network. We denote
the hypothesis class by

HV,E,σ = {hV,E,σ,w : w is a mapping from E to R}.

(20.1)

20.3 The Expressive Power of Neural Networks

271

That is, the parameters specifying a hypothesis in the hypothesis class are the
weights over the edges of the network.

We can now study the approximation error, estimation error, and optimization
error of such hypothesis classes. In Section 20.3 we study the approximation
error of HV,E,σ by studying what type of functions hypotheses in HV,E,σ can
implement, in terms of the size of the underlying graph. In Section 20.4 we
study the estimation error of HV,E,σ, for the case of binary classiﬁcation (i.e.,
VT = 1 and σ is the sign function), by analyzing its VC dimension. Finally, in
Section 20.5 we show that it is computationally hard to learn the class HV,E,σ,
even if the underlying graph is small, and in Section 20.6 we present the most
commonly used heuristic for training HV,E,σ.

20.3

The Expressive Power of Neural Networks

In this section we study the expressive power of neural networks, namely, what
type of functions can be implemented using a neural network. More concretely,
we will ﬁx some architecture, V, E, σ, and will study what functions hypotheses
in HV,E,σ can implement, as a function of the size of V .
We start the discussion with studying which type of Boolean functions (i.e.,
functions from {±1}n to {±1}) can be implemented by HV,E,sign. Observe that
for every computer in which real numbers are stored using b bits, whenever we
calculate a function f : Rn → R on such a computer we in fact calculate a
function g : {±1}nb → {±1}b. Therefore, studying which Boolean functions can
be implemented by HV,E,sign can tell us which functions can be implemented on
a computer that stores real numbers using b bits.

We begin with a simple claim, showing that without restricting the size of the
network, every Boolean function can be implemented using a neural network of
depth 2.

claim 20.1 For every n, there exists a graph (V, E) of depth 2, such that
HV,E,sign contains all functions from {±1}n to {±1}.

Proof We construct a graph with |V0| = n + 1,|V1| = 2n + 1, and |V2| = 1. Let
E be all possible edges between adjacent layers. Now, let f : {±1}n → {±1}
be some Boolean function. We need to show that we can adjust the weights so
that the network will implement f . Let u1, . . . , uk be all vectors in {±1}n on
which f outputs 1. Observe that for every i and every x ∈ {±1}n, if x (cid:54)= ui
then (cid:104)x, ui(cid:105) ≤ n − 2 and if x = ui then (cid:104)x, ui(cid:105) = n. It follows that the function
gi(x) = sign((cid:104)x, ui(cid:105)− n + 1) equals 1 if and only if x = ui. It follows that we can
adapt the weights between V0 and V1 so that for every i ∈ [k], the neuron v1,i
implements the function gi(x). Next, we observe that f (x) is the disjunction of

272

the functions gi(x), and therefore can be written as

f (x) = sign

gi(x) + k − 1

(cid:32) k(cid:88)

(cid:33)

,

which concludes our proof.

i=1

The preceding claim shows that neural networks can implement any Boolean
function. However, this is a very weak property, as the size of the resulting
network might be exponentially large. In the construction given at the proof of
Claim 20.1, the number of nodes in the hidden layer is exponentially large. This
is not an artifact of our proof, as stated in the following theorem.

theorem 20.2 For every n, let s(n) be the minimal integer such that there
exists a graph (V, E) with |V | = s(n) such that the hypothesis class HV,E,sign
contains all the functions from {0, 1}n to {0, 1}. Then, s(n) is exponential in n.
Similar results hold for HV,E,σ where σ is the sigmoid function.
Proof Suppose that for some (V, E) we have that HV,E,sign contains all functions
from {0, 1}n to {0, 1}. It follows that it can shatter the set of m = 2n vectors in
{0, 1}n and hence the VC dimension of HV,E,sign is 2n. On the other hand, the
VC dimension of HV,E,sign is bounded by O(|E| log(|E|)) ≤ O(|V |3), as we will
show in the next section. This implies that |V | ≥ Ω(2n/3), which concludes our
proof for the case of networks with the sign activation function. The proof for
the sigmoid case is analogous.

It is possible to derive a similar theorem for HV,E,σ for any σ, as
Remark 20.1
long as we restrict the weights so that it is possible to express every weight using
a number of bits which is bounded by a universal constant. We can even con-
sider hypothesis classes where diﬀerent neurons can employ diﬀerent activation
functions, as long as the number of allowed activation functions is also ﬁnite.

Which functions can we express using a network of polynomial size? The pre-
ceding claim tells us that it is impossible to express all Boolean functions using
a network of polynomial size. On the positive side, in the following we show
that all Boolean functions that can be calculated in time O(T (n)) can also be
expressed by a network of size O(T (n)2).
theorem 20.3 Let T : N → N and for every n, let Fn be the set of functions
that can be implemented using a Turing machine using runtime of at most T (n).
Then, there exist constants b, c ∈ R+ such that for every n, there is a graph
(Vn, En) of size at most c T (n)2 + b such that HVn,En,sign contains Fn.

The proof of this theorem relies on the relation between the time complexity
of programs and their circuit complexity (see, for example, Sipser (2006)). In a
nutshell, a Boolean circuit is a type of network in which the individual neurons

20.3 The Expressive Power of Neural Networks

273

implement conjunctions, disjunctions, and negation of their inputs. Circuit com-
plexity measures the size of Boolean circuits required to calculate functions. The
relation between time complexity and circuit complexity can be seen intuitively
as follows. We can model each step of the execution of a computer program as a
simple operation on its memory state. Therefore, the neurons at each layer of the
network will reﬂect the memory state of the computer at the corresponding time,
and the translation to the next layer of the network involves a simple calculation
that can be carried out by the network. To relate Boolean circuits to networks
with the sign activation function, we need to show that we can implement the
operations of conjunction, disjunction, and negation, using the sign activation
function. Clearly, we can implement the negation operator using the sign activa-
tion function. The following lemma shows that the sign activation function can
also implement conjunctions and disjunctions of its inputs.

lemma 20.4
Suppose that a neuron v, that implements the sign activation
function, has k incoming edges, connecting it to neurons whose outputs are in
{±1}. Then, by adding one more edge, linking a “constant” neuron to v, and
by adjusting the weights on the edges to v, the output of v can implement the
conjunction or the disjunction of its inputs.
Proof Simply observe that if f : {±1}k → {±1} is the conjunction func-
tion, f (x) = ∧ixi, then it can be written as f (x) = sign
.
Similarly, the disjunction function, f (x) = ∨ixi, can be written as f (x) =

So far we have discussed Boolean functions. In Exercise 1 we show that neural
networks are universal approximators. That is, for every ﬁxed precision param-
eter,  > 0, and every Lipschitz function f : [−1, 1]n → [−1, 1], it is possible to
construct a network such that for every input x ∈ [−1, 1]n, the network outputs
a number between f (x) −  and f (x) + . However, as in the case of Boolean
functions, the size of the network here again cannot be polynomial in n. This is
formalized in the following theorem, whose proof is a direct corollary of Theo-
rem 20.2 and is left as an exercise.
theorem 20.5 Fix some  ∈ (0, 1). For every n, let s(n) be the minimal integer
such that there exists a graph (V, E) with |V | = s(n) such that the hypothesis class
HV,E,σ, with σ being the sigmoid function, can approximate, to within precision
of , every 1-Lipschitz function f : [−1, 1]n → [−1, 1]. Then s(n) is exponential
in n.

20.3.1

Geometric Intuition
We next provide several geometric illustrations of functions f : R2 → {±1}
and show how to express them using a neural network with the sign activation
function.

274

Neural Networks

Let us start with a depth 2 network, namely, a network with a single hidden
layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer implements a halfspace predictor. Then,
the single neuron at the output layer applies a halfspace on top of the binary
outputs of the neurons in the hidden layer. As we have shown before, a halfspace
can implement the conjunction function. Therefore, such networks contain all
hypotheses which are an intersection of k − 1 halfspaces, where k is the number
of neurons in the hidden layer; namely, they can express all convex polytopes
with k − 1 faces. An example of an intersection of 5 halfspaces is given in the
following.

We have shown that a neuron in layer V2 can implement a function that
indicates whether x is in some convex polytope. By adding one more layer, and
letting the neuron in the output layer implement the disjunction of its inputs,
we get a network that computes the union of polytopes. An illustration of such
a function is given in the following.

20.4

The Sample Complexity of Neural Networks
Next we discuss the sample complexity of learning the class HV,E,σ. Recall that
the fundamental theorem of learning tells us that the sample complexity of learn-
ing a hypothesis class of binary classiﬁers depends on its VC dimension. There-
fore, we focus on calculating the VC dimension of hypothesis classes of the form
HV,E,σ, where the output layer of the graph contains a single neuron.
We start with the sign activation function, namely, with HV,E,sign. What is
the VC dimension of this class? Intuitively, since we learn |E| parameters, the
VC dimension should be order of |E|. This is indeed the case, as formalized by
the following theorem.
theorem 20.6 The VC dimension of HV,E,sign is O(|E| log(|E|)).

20.4 The Sample Complexity of Neural Networks

275

Proof To simplify the notation throughout the proof, let us denote the hy-
pothesis class by H. Recall the deﬁnition of the growth function, τH(m), from
Section 6.5.1. This function measures maxC⊂X :|C|=m |HC|, where HC is the re-
striction of H to functions from C to {0, 1}. We can naturally extend the deﬁ-
nition for a set of functions from X to some ﬁnite set Y, by letting HC be the
restriction of H to functions from C to Y, and keeping the deﬁnition of τH(m)
intact.
Our neural network is deﬁned by a layered graph. Let V0, . . . , VT be the layers
of the graph. Fix some t ∈ [T ]. By assigning diﬀerent weights on the edges
between Vt−1 and Vt, we obtain diﬀerent functions from R|Vt−1| → {±1}|Vt|. Let
H(t) be the class of all possible such mappings from R|Vt−1| → {±1}|Vt|. Then,
H can be written as a composition, H = H(T ) ◦ . . .◦H(1). In Exercise 4 we show
that the growth function of a composition of hypothesis classes is bounded by
the products of the growth functions of the individual classes. Therefore,

τH(m) ≤ T(cid:89)

t=1

τH(t) (m).

In addition, each H(t) can be written as a product of function classes, H(t) =
H(t,1) × ··· ×H(t,|Vt|), where each H(t,j) is all functions from layer t − 1 to {±1}
that the jth neuron of layer t can implement. In Exercise 3 we bound product
classes, and this yields

τH(t) (m) ≤

τH(t,i)(m).

|Vt|(cid:89)

i=1

Let dt,i be the number of edges that are headed to the ith neuron of layer t.
Since the neuron is a homogenous halfspace hypothesis and the VC dimension
of homogenous halfspaces is the dimension of their input, we have by Sauer’s
lemma that

τH(t,i)(m) ≤(cid:16) em
(cid:80)
τH(m) ≤ (em)

dt,i

(cid:17)dt,i ≤ (em)dt,i.

t,i dt,i = (em)|E|.

Overall, we obtained that

Now, assume that there are m shattered points. Then, we must have τH(m) =
2m, from which we obtain

2m ≤ (em)|E| ⇒ m ≤ |E| log(em)/ log(2).

The claim follows by Lemma A.2.

Next, we consider HV,E,σ, where σ is the sigmoid function. Surprisingly, it
turns out that the VC dimension of HV,E,σ is lower bounded by Ω(|E|2) (see
Exercise 5.) That is, the VC dimension is the number of tunable parameters
squared. It is also possible to upper bound the VC dimension by O(|V |2 |E|2),
but the proof is beyond the scope of this book. In any case, since in practice

276

Neural Networks

we only consider networks in which the weights have a short representation as
ﬂoating point numbers with O(1) bits, by using the discretization trick we easily
obtain that such networks have a VC dimension of O(|E|), even if we use the
sigmoid activation function.

20.5

The Runtime of Learning Neural Networks

In the previous sections we have shown that the class of neural networks with an
underlying graph of polynomial size can express all functions that can be imple-
mented eﬃciently, and that the sample complexity has a favorable dependence
on the size of the network. In this section we turn to the analysis of the time
complexity of training neural networks.
We ﬁrst show that it is NP hard to implement the ERM rule with respect to
HV,E,sign even for networks with a single hidden layer that contain just 4 neurons
in the hidden layer.
theorem 20.7 Let k ≥ 3. For every n, let (V, E) be a layered graph with n
input nodes, k + 1 nodes at the (single) hidden layer, where one of them is the
constant neuron, and a single output node. Then, it is NP hard to implement the
ERM rule with respect to HV,E,sign.

The proof relies on a reduction from the k-coloring problem and is left as

Exercise 6.
One way around the preceding hardness result could be that for the purpose
of learning, it may suﬃce to ﬁnd a predictor h ∈ H with low empirical error,
not necessarily an exact ERM. However, it turns out that even the task of ﬁnd-
ing weights that result in close-to-minimal empirical error is computationally
infeasible (see (Bartlett & Ben-David 2002)).

One may also wonder whether it may be possible to change the architecture
of the network so as to circumvent the hardness result. That is, maybe ERM
with respect to the original network structure is computationally hard but ERM
with respect to some other, larger, network may be implemented eﬃciently (see
Chapter 8 for examples of such cases). Another possibility is to use other acti-
vation functions (such as sigmoids, or any other type of eﬃciently computable
activation functions). There is a strong indication that all of such approaches
are doomed to fail. Indeed, under some cryptographic assumption, the problem
of learning intersections of halfspaces is known to be hard even in the repre-
sentation independent model of learning (see Klivans & Sherstov (2006)). This
implies that, under the same cryptographic assumption, any hypothesis class
which contains intersections of halfspaces cannot be learned eﬃciently.

A widely used heuristic for training neural networks relies on the SGD frame-
work we studied in Chapter 14. There, we have shown that SGD is a successful
learner if the loss function is convex. In neural networks, the loss function is
highly nonconvex. Nevertheless, we can still implement the SGD algorithm and

20.6 SGD and Backpropagation

277

hope it will ﬁnd a reasonable solution (as happens to be the case in several
practical tasks).

20.6

SGD and Backpropagation

The problem of ﬁnding a hypothesis in HV,E,σ with a low risk amounts to the
problem of tuning the weights over the edges. In this section we show how to
apply a heuristic search for good weights using the SGD algorithm. Throughout
this section we assume that σ is the sigmoid function, σ(a) = 1/(1 + e−a), but
the derivation holds for any diﬀerentiable scalar function.

Since E is a ﬁnite set, we can think of the weight function as a vector w ∈ R|E|.
Suppose the network has n input neurons and k output neurons, and denote by
hw : Rn → Rk the function calculated by the network if the weight function is
deﬁned by w. Let us denote by ∆(hw(x), y) the loss of predicting hw(x) when
the target is y ∈ Y. For concreteness, we will take ∆ to be the squared loss,
2(cid:107)hw(x) − y(cid:107)2; however, similar derivation can be obtained for
∆(hw(x), y) = 1
every diﬀerentiable function. Finally, given a distribution D over the examples
domain, Rn × Rk, let LD(w) be the risk of the network, namely,

LD(w) = E

(x,y)∼D [∆(hw(x), y)] .

Recall the SGD algorithm for minimizing the risk function LD(w). We repeat
the pseudocode from Chapter 14 with a few modiﬁcations, which are relevant
to the neural network application because of the nonconvexity of the objective
function. First, while in Chapter 14 we initialized w to be the zero vector, here
we initialize w to be a randomly chosen vector with values close to zero. This
is because an initialization with the zero vector will lead all hidden neurons to
have the same weights (if the network is a full layered network). In addition,
the hope is that if we repeat the SGD procedure several times, where each time
we initialize the process with a new random vector, one of the runs will lead
to a good local minimum. Second, while a ﬁxed step size, η, is guaranteed to
be good enough for convex problems, here we utilize a variable step size, ηt, as
deﬁned in Section 14.4.2. Because of the nonconvexity of the loss function, the
choice of the sequence ηt is more signiﬁcant, and it is tuned in practice by a trial
and error manner. Third, we output the best performing vector on a validation
set. In addition, it is sometimes helpful to add regularization on the weights,
with parameter λ. That is, we try to minimize LD(w) + λ
gradient does not have a closed form solution. Instead, it is implemented using
the backpropagation algorithm, which will be described in the sequel.

279

Explaining How Backpropagation Calculates the Gradient:
We next explain how the backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradient of
the loss function on an example (x, y) with respect to the vector w. Let us ﬁrst
recall a few deﬁnitions from vector calculus. Each element of the gradient is
the partial derivative with respect to the variable in w corresponding to one of
the edges of the network. Recall the deﬁnition of a partial derivative. Given a
function f : Rn → R, the partial derivative with respect to the ith variable at w
is obtained by ﬁxing the values of w1, . . . , wi−1, wi+1, wn, which yields the scalar
function g : R → R deﬁned by g(a) = f ((w1, . . . , wi−1, wi + a, wi+1, . . . , wn)),
and then taking the derivative of g at 0. For a function with multiple outputs,
f : Rn → Rm, the Jacobian of f at w ∈ Rn, denoted Jw(f ), is the m × n matrix
whose i, j element is the partial derivative of fi : Rn → R w.r.t. its jth variable
at w. Note that if m = 1 then the Jacobian matrix is the gradient of the function
(represented as a row vector). Two examples of Jacobian calculations, which we
will later use, are as follows.
• Let f (w) = Aw for A ∈ Rm,n. Then Jw(f ) = A.
• For every n, we use the notation σ to denote the function from Rn to Rn
which applies the sigmoid function element-wise. That is, α = σ(θ) means
1+exp(−θi) . It is easy to verify
that for every i we have αi = σ(θi) =
that Jθ(σ) is a diagonal matrix whose (i, i) entry is σ(cid:48)(θi), where σ(cid:48) is
the derivative function of the (scalar) sigmoid function, namely, σ(cid:48)(θi) =
(1+exp(θi))(1+exp(−θi)) . We also use the notation diag(σ(cid:48)(θ)) to denote this
matrix.

1

The chain rule for taking the derivative of a composition of functions can be
written in terms of the Jacobian as follows. Given two functions f : Rn → Rm
and g : Rk → Rn, we have that the Jacobian of the composition function,
(f ◦ g) : Rk → Rm, at w, is

Jw(f ◦ g) = Jg(w)(f )Jw(g).

For example, for g(w) = Aw, where A ∈ Rn,k, we have that

Jw(σ ◦ g) = diag(σ(cid:48)(Aw)) A.

To describe the backpropagation algorithm, let us ﬁrst decompose V into the
layers of the graph, V = ·∪T
t=0Vt. For every t, let us write Vt = {vt,1, . . . , vt,kt},
where kt = |Vt|. In addition, for every t denote Wt ∈ Rkt+1,kt a matrix which
gives a weight to every potential edge between Vt and Vt+1. If the edge exists in
E then we set Wt,i,j to be the weight, according to w, of the edge (vt,j, vt+1,i).
Otherwise, we add a “phantom” edge and set its weight to be zero, Wt,i,j = 0.
Since when calculating the partial derivative with respect to the weight of some
edge we ﬁx all other weights, these additional “phantom” edges have no eﬀect
on the partial derivative with respect to existing edges. It follows that we can
assume, without loss of generality, that all edges exist, that is, E = ∪t(Vt×Vt+1).

280

Neural Networks

Next, we discuss how to calculate the partial derivatives with respect to the
edges from Vt−1 to Vt, namely, with respect to the elements in Wt−1. Since we
ﬁx all other weights of the network, it follows that the outputs of all the neurons
in Vt−1 are ﬁxed numbers which do not depend on the weights in Wt−1. Denote
the corresponding vector by ot−1. In addition, let us denote by (cid:96)t : Rkt → R the
loss function of the subnetwork deﬁned by layers Vt, . . . , VT as a function of the
outputs of the neurons in Vt. The input to the neurons of Vt can be written as
at = Wt−1ot−1 and the output of the neurons of Vt is ot = σ(at). That is, for
every j we have ot,j = σ(at,j). We obtain that the loss, as a function of Wt−1,
can be written as

gt(Wt−1) = (cid:96)t(ot) = (cid:96)t(σ(at)) = (cid:96)t(σ(Wt−1ot−1)).

It would be convenient to rewrite this as follows. Let wt−1 ∈ Rkt−1kt be the
column vector obtained by concatenating the rows of Wt−1 and then taking the
transpose of the resulting long vector. Deﬁne by Ot−1 the kt × (kt−1kt) matrix

Then, Wt−1ot−1 = Ot−1wt−1, so we can also write

gt(wt−1) = (cid:96)t(σ(Ot−1 wt−1)).

Therefore, applying the chain rule, we obtain that

Jwt−1(gt) = Jσ(Ot−1wt−1)((cid:96)t) diag(σ(cid:48)(Ot−1wt−1)) Ot−1.

Using our notation we have ot = σ(Ot−1wt−1) and at = Ot−1wt−1, which yields

Jwt−1 (gt) = Jot((cid:96)t) diag(σ(cid:48)(at)) Ot−1.

Let us also denote δt = Jot((cid:96)t). Then, we can further rewrite the preceding as

t−1 ,

t−1

(20.3)

Jwt−1(gt) =(cid:0)δt,1 σ(cid:48)(at,1) o(cid:62)

(cid:1) .

It is left to calculate the vector δt = Jot((cid:96)t) for every t. This is the gradient
of (cid:96)t at ot. We calculate this in a recursive manner. First observe that for the
last layer we have that (cid:96)T (u) = ∆(u, y), where ∆ is the loss function. Since we
2(cid:107)u−y(cid:107)2 we obtain that Ju((cid:96)T ) = (u−y). In particular,
assume that ∆(u, y) = 1
δT = JoT ((cid:96)T ) = (oT − y). Next, note that

(cid:96)t(u) = (cid:96)t+1(σ(Wtu)).

Therefore, by the chain rule,

Ju((cid:96)t) = Jσ(Wtu)((cid:96)t+1)diag(σ(cid:48)(Wtu))Wt.

20.7 Summary

281

In particular,

δt = Jot((cid:96)t) = Jσ(Wtot)((cid:96)t+1)diag(σ(cid:48)(Wtot))Wt

= Jot+1((cid:96)t+1)diag(σ(cid:48)(at+1))Wt
= δt+1 diag(σ(cid:48)(at+1))Wt.

In summary, we can ﬁrst calculate the vectors {at, ot} from the bottom of
the network to its top. Then, we calculate the vectors {δt} from the top of
the network back to its bottom. Once we have all of these vectors, the partial
derivatives are easily obtained using Equation (20.3). We have thus shown that
the pseudocode of backpropagation indeed calculates the gradient.

problem of training the network on the basis of training data is computationally
hard. We have presented the SGD framework as a heuristic approach for training
neural networks and described the backpropagation algorithm which eﬃciently

Bibliographic Remarks

Neural networks were extensively studied in the 1980s and early 1990s, but with
mixed empirical success. In recent years, a combination of algorithmic advance-
ments, as well as increasing computational power and data size, has led to a
breakthrough in the eﬀectiveness of neural networks. In particular, “deep net-
works” (i.e., networks of more than 2 layers) have shown very impressive practical
performance on a variety of domains. A few examples include convolutional net-
works (Lecun & Bengio 1995), restricted Boltzmann machines (Hinton, Osindero
& Teh 2006), auto-encoders (Ranzato, Huang, Boureau & Lecun 2007, Bengio &
LeCun 2007, Collobert & Weston 2008, Lee, Grosse, Ranganath & Ng 2009, Le,
Ranzato, Monga, Devin, Corrado, Chen, Dean & Ng 2012), and sum-product
networks (Livni, Shalev-Shwartz & Shamir 2013, Poon & Domingos 2011). See
also (Bengio 2009) and the references therein.

The expressive power of neural networks and the relation to circuit complexity
have been extensively studied in (Parberry 1994). For the analysis of the sample
complexity of neural networks we refer the reader to (Anthony & Bartlet 1999).
Our proof technique of Theorem 20.6 is due to Kakade and Tewari lecture notes.

Neural Networks

Klivans & Sherstov (2006) have shown that for any c > 0, intersections of nc
halfspaces over {±1}n are not eﬃciently PAC learnable, even if we allow repre-
sentation independent learning. This hardness result relies on the cryptographic
assumption that there is no polynomial time solution to the unique-shortest-
vector problem. As we have argued, this implies that there cannot be an eﬃcient
algorithm for training neural networks, even if we allow larger networks or other
activation functions that can be implemented eﬃciently.

The backpropagation algorithm has been introduced in Rumelhart, Hinton &

Williams (1986).

Additional Learning Models

21 Online Learning

In this chapter we describe a diﬀerent model of learning, which is called online
learning. Previously, we studied the PAC learning model, in which the learner
ﬁrst receives a batch of training examples, uses the training set to learn a hy-
pothesis, and only when learning is completed uses the learned hypothesis for
predicting the label of new examples. In our papayas learning problem, this
means that we should ﬁrst buy a bunch of papayas and taste them all. Then, we
use all of this information to learn a prediction rule that determines the taste
of new papayas. In contrast, in online learning there is no separation between a
training phase and a prediction phase. Instead, each time we buy a papaya, it
is ﬁrst considered a test example since we should predict whether it is going to
taste good. Then, after taking a bite from the papaya, we know the true label,
and the same papaya can be used as a training example that can help us improve
our prediction mechanism for future papayas.

Concretely, online learning takes place in a sequence of consecutive rounds.
On each online round, the learner ﬁrst receives an instance (the learner buys
a papaya and knows its shape and color, which form the instance). Then, the
learner is required to predict a label (is the papaya tasty?). At the end of the
round, the learner obtains the correct label (he tastes the papaya and then knows
whether it is tasty or not). Finally, the learner uses this information to improve
his future predictions.

To analyze online learning, we follow a similar route to our study of PAC
learning. We start with online binary classiﬁcation problems. We consider both
the realizable case, in which we assume, as prior knowledge, that all the labels are
generated by some hypothesis from a given hypothesis class, and the unrealizable
case, which corresponds to the agnostic PAC learning model. In particular, we
present an important algorithm called Weighted-Majority. Next, we study online
learning problems in which the loss function is convex. Finally, we present the
Perceptron algorithm as an example of the use of surrogate convex loss functions
in the online learning model.

Online Learning

21.1

Online Classiﬁcation in the Realizable Case

Online learning is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds, where at round
t the learner is given an instance, xt, taken from an instance domain X , and is
required to provide its label. We denote the predicted label by pt. After predicting
the label, the correct label, yt ∈ {0, 1}, is revealed to the learner. The learner’s
goal is to make as few prediction mistakes as possible during this process. The
learner tries to deduce information from previous rounds so as to improve its
predictions on future rounds.

Clearly, learning is hopeless if there is no correlation between past and present
rounds. Previously in the book, we studied the PAC model in which we assume
that past and present examples are sampled i.i.d. from the same distribution
source. In the online learning model we make no statistical assumptions regard-
ing the origin of the sequence of examples. The sequence is allowed to be deter-
ministic, stochastic, or even adversarially adaptive to the learner’s own behavior
(as in the case of spam e-mail ﬁltering). Naturally, an adversary can make the
number of prediction mistakes of our online learning algorithm arbitrarily large.
For example, the adversary can present the same instance on each online round,
wait for the learner’s prediction, and provide the opposite label as the correct
label.

To make nontrivial statements we must further restrict the problem. The real-
izability assumption is one possible natural restriction. In the realizable case, we
assume that all the labels are generated by some hypothesis, h(cid:63) : X → Y. Fur-
thermore, h(cid:63) is taken from a hypothesis class H, which is known to the learner.
This is analogous to the PAC learning model we studied in Chapter 3. With this
restriction on the sequence, the learner should make as few mistakes as possible,
assuming that both h(cid:63) and the sequence of instances can be chosen by an ad-
versary. For an online learning algorithm, A, we denote by MA(H) the maximal
number of mistakes A might make on a sequence of examples which is labeled by
some h(cid:63) ∈ H. We emphasize again that both h(cid:63) and the sequence of instances
can be chosen by an adversary. A bound on MA(H) is called a mistake-bound and
we will study how to design algorithms for which MA(H) is minimal. Formally:
definition 21.1 (Mistake Bounds, Online Learnability) Let H be a hypoth-
esis class and let A be an online learning algorithm. Given any sequence S =
(x1, h(cid:63)(y1)), . . . , (xT , h(cid:63)(yT )), where T is any integer and h(cid:63) ∈ H, let MA(S) be
the number of mistakes A makes on the sequence S. We denote by MA(H) the
supremum of MA(S) over all sequences of the above form. A bound of the form
MA(H) ≤ B < ∞ is called a mistake bound. We say that a hypothesis class H is
online learnable if there exists an algorithm A for which MA(H) ≤ B < ∞.

Our goal is to study which hypothesis classes are learnable in the online model,
and in particular to ﬁnd good learning algorithms for a given hypothesis class.

Remark 21.1 Throughout this section and the next, we ignore the computa-

289

tional aspect of learning, and do not restrict the algorithms to be eﬃcient. In
Section 21.3 and Section 21.4 we study eﬃcient online learning algorithms.

To simplify the presentation, we start with the case of a ﬁnite hypothesis class,

namely, |H| < ∞.
In PAC learning, we identiﬁed ERM as a good learning algorithm, in the sense
that if H is learnable then it is learnable by the rule ERMH. A natural learning
rule for online learning is to use (at any online round) any ERM hypothesis,
namely, any hypothesis which is consistent with all past examples.

Consistent
input: A ﬁnite hypothesis class H
initialize: V1 = H
for t = 1, 2, . . .
receive xt
choose any h ∈ Vt
predict pt = h(xt)
receive true label yt = h(cid:63)(xt)
update Vt+1 = {h ∈ Vt : h(xt) = yt}

The Consistent algorithm maintains a set, Vt, of all the hypotheses which
are consistent with (x1, y1), . . . , (xt−1, yt−1). This set is often called the version
space. It then picks any hypothesis from Vt and predicts according to this hy-
pothesis.

Obviously, whenever Consistent makes a prediction mistake, at least one
hypothesis is removed from Vt. Therefore, after making M mistakes we have
|Vt| ≤ |H| − M . Since Vt is always nonempty (by the realizability assumption it
contains h(cid:63)) we have 1 ≤ |Vt| ≤ |H| − M . Rearranging, we obtain the following:
corollary 21.2 Let H be a ﬁnite hypothesis class. The Consistent algorithm
enjoys the mistake bound MConsistent(H) ≤ |H| − 1.

It is rather easy to construct a hypothesis class and a sequence of examples on
which Consistent will indeed make |H|− 1 mistakes (see Exercise 1). Therefore,
we present a better algorithm in which we choose h ∈ Vt in a smarter way. We
shall see that this algorithm is guaranteed to make exponentially fewer mistakes.

Halving
input: A ﬁnite hypothesis class H
initialize: V1 = H
for t = 1, 2, . . .
receive xt
predict pt = argmaxr∈{0,1} |{h ∈ Vt : h(xt) = r}|
(in case of a tie predict pt = 1)
receive true label yt = h(cid:63)(xt)
update Vt+1 = {h ∈ Vt : h(xt) = yt}

290

Online Learning

theorem 21.3 Let H be a ﬁnite hypothesis class. The Halving algorithm
enjoys the mistake bound MHalving(H) ≤ log2(|H|).
Proof We simply note that whenever the algorithm errs we have |Vt+1| ≤ |Vt|/2,
(hence the name Halving). Therefore, if M is the total number of mistakes, we
have

1 ≤ |VT +1| ≤ |H| 2−M .
Rearranging this inequality we conclude our proof.

Of course, Halving’s mistake bound is much better than Consistent’s mistake
bound. We already see that online learning is diﬀerent from PAC learning—while
in PAC, any ERM hypothesis is good, in online learning choosing an arbitrary
ERM hypothesis is far from being optimal.

21.1.1

Online Learnability

We next take a more general approach, and aim at characterizing online learn-
ability. In particular, we target the following question: What is the optimal online
learning algorithm for a given hypothesis class H?

We present a dimension of hypothesis classes that characterizes the best achiev-
able mistake bound. This measure was proposed by Nick Littlestone and we
therefore refer to it as Ldim(H).

To motivate the deﬁnition of Ldim it is convenient to view the online learning
process as a game between two players: the learner versus the environment. On
round t of the game, the environment picks an instance xt, the learner predicts a
label pt ∈ {0, 1}, and ﬁnally the environment outputs the true label, yt ∈ {0, 1}.
Suppose that the environment wants to make the learner err on the ﬁrst T rounds
of the game. Then, it must output yt = 1 − pt, and the only question is how it
should choose the instances xt in such a way that ensures that for some h(cid:63) ∈ H
we have yt = h(cid:63)(xt) for all t ∈ [T ].

A strategy for an adversarial environment can be formally described as a
binary tree, as follows. Each node of the tree is associated with an instance from
X . Initially, the environment presents to the learner the instance associated with
the root of the tree. Then, if the learner predicts pt = 1 the environment will
declare that this is a wrong prediction (i.e., yt = 0) and will traverse to the right
child of the current node. If the learner predicts pt = 0 then the environment
will set yt = 1 and will traverse to the left child. This process will continue and
at each round, the environment will present the instance associated with the
current node.

Formally, consider a complete binary tree of depth T (we deﬁne the depth of
the tree as the number of edges in a path from the root to a leaf). We have
2T +1 − 1 nodes in such a tree, and we attach an instance to each node. Let
v1, . . . , v2T +1−1 be these instances. We start from the root of the tree, and set
x1 = v1. At round t, we set xt = vit where it is the current node. At the end of

Figure 21.1 An illustration of a shattered tree of depth 2. The dashed path

The preceding strategy for the environment succeeds only if for every (y1, . . . , yT )
there exists h ∈ H such that yt = h(xt) for all t ∈ [T ]. This leads to the following
deﬁnition.
definition 21.4 (H Shattered Tree) A shattered tree of depth d is a sequence
of instances v1, . . . , v2d−1 in X such that for every labeling (y1, . . . , yd) ∈ {0, 1}d
there exists h ∈ H such that for all t ∈ [d] we have h(vit) = yt where it =

2t−1 +(cid:80)t−1

j=1 yj 2t−1−j.

An illustration of a shattered tree of depth 2 is given in Figure 21.1.

definition 21.5 (Littlestone’s Dimension (Ldim)) Ldim(H) is the maximal
integer T such that there exists a shattered tree of depth T , which is shattered
by H.

The deﬁnition of Ldim and the discussion above immediately imply the fol-

lowing:

lemma 21.6 No algorithm can have a mistake bound strictly smaller than
Ldim(H); namely, for every algorithm, A, we have MA(H) ≥ Ldim(H).
Proof Let T = Ldim(H) and let v1, . . . , v2T −1 be a sequence that satisﬁes the
requirements in the deﬁnition of Ldim. If the environment sets xt = vit and
yt = 1− pt for all t ∈ [T ], then the learner makes T mistakes while the deﬁnition
of Ldim implies that there exists a hypothesis h ∈ H such that yt = h(xt) for all
t.

Let us now give several examples.

Example 21.2 Let H be a ﬁnite hypothesis class. Clearly, any tree that is shat-
tered by H has depth of at most log2(|H|). Therefore, Ldim(H) ≤ log2(|H|).
Another way to conclude this inequality is by combining Lemma 21.6 with The-
orem 21.3.
Example 21.3 Let X = {1, . . . , d} and H = {h1, . . . , hd} where hj(x) = 1 iﬀ

292

Online Learning

x = j. Then, it is easy to show that Ldim(H) = 1 while |H| = d can be arbitrarily
large. Therefore, this example shows that Ldim(H) can be signiﬁcantly smaller
than log2(|H|).
Example 21.4 Let X = [0, 1] and H = {x (cid:55)→ 1[x<a] : a ∈ [0, 1]}; namely, H is
the class of thresholds on the interval [0, 1]. Then, Ldim(H) = ∞. To see this,
consider the tree

1/2

1/4

3/4

1/8

3/8

5/8

7/8

This tree is shattered by H. And, because of the density of the reals, this tree
can be made arbitrarily deep.

Lemma 21.6 states that Ldim(H) lower bounds the mistake bound of any
algorithm. Interestingly, there is a standard algorithm whose mistake bound
matches this lower bound. The algorithm is similar to the Halving algorithm.
Recall that the prediction of Halving is made according to a majority vote of
the hypotheses which are consistent with previous examples. We denoted this
t = {h ∈ Vt :
set by Vt. Put another way, Halving partitions Vt into two sets: V +
h(xt) = 1} and V −
t = {h ∈ Vt : h(xt) = 0}. It then predicts according to the
larger of the two groups. The rationale behind this prediction is that whenever
Halving makes a mistake it ends up with |Vt+1| ≤ 0.5|Vt|.

The optimal algorithm we present in the following uses the same idea, but
instead of predicting according to the larger class, it predicts according to the
class with larger Ldim.

gorithm.

293

lemma 21.7

SOA enjoys the mistake bound MSOA(H) ≤ Ldim(H).

Proof
It suﬃces to prove that whenever the algorithm makes a prediction mis-
take we have Ldim(Vt+1) ≤ Ldim(Vt) − 1. We prove this claim by assuming the
contrary, that is, Ldim(Vt+1) = Ldim(Vt). If this holds true, then the deﬁnition
of pt implies that Ldim(V (r)
) = Ldim(Vt) for both r = 1 and r = 0. But, then
we can construct a shaterred tree of depth Ldim(Vt) + 1 for the class Vt, which
leads to the desired contradiction.

t

Combining Lemma 21.7 and Lemma 21.6 we obtain:

corollary 21.8 Let H be any hypothesis class. Then, the standard optimal
algorithm enjoys the mistake bound MSOA(H) = Ldim(H) and no other algorithm
can have MA(H) < Ldim(H).

Comparison to VC Dimension
In the PAC learning model, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension of
the class H. Recall that the VC dimension of a class H is the maximal number
d such that there are instances x1, . . . , xd that are shattered by H. That is, for
any sequence of labels (y1, . . . , yd) ∈ {0, 1}d there exists a hypothesis h ∈ H
that gives exactly this sequence of labels. The following theorem relates the VC
dimension to the Littlestone dimension.
theorem 21.9 For any class H, VCdim(H) ≤ Ldim(H), and there are classes
for which strict inequality holds. Furthermore, the gap can be arbitrarily larger.
Proof We ﬁrst prove that VCdim(H) ≤ Ldim(H). Suppose VCdim(H) = d and
let x1, . . . , xd be a shattered set. We now construct a complete binary tree of
instances v1, . . . , v2d−1, where all nodes at depth i are set to be xi – see the
following illustration:

x1

x2

x2

x3

x3

x3

Now, the deﬁnition of a shattered set clearly implies that we got a valid shattered
tree of depth d, and we conclude that VCdim(H) ≤ Ldim(H). To show that the
gap can be arbitrarily large simply note that the class given in Example 21.4 has
VC dimension of 1 whereas its Littlestone dimension is inﬁnite.

In the previous section we studied online learnability in the realizable case. We
now consider the unrealizable case. Similarly to the agnostic PAC model, we
no longer assume that all labels are generated by some h(cid:63) ∈ H, but we require
the learner to be competitive with the best ﬁxed predictor from H. This is
captured by the regret of the algorithm, which measures how “sorry” the learner
is, in retrospect, not to have followed the predictions of some hypothesis h ∈ H.
Formally, the regret of an algorithm A relative to h when running on a sequence
of T examples is deﬁned as

RegretA(h, T ) =

sup

(x1,y1),...,(xT ,yT )

and the regret of the algorithm relative to a hypothesis class H is

RegretA(H, T ) = sup
h∈H

RegretA(h, T ).

(21.2)
We restate the learner’s goal as having the lowest possible regret relative to H.
An interesting question is whether we can derive an algorithm with low regret,
meaning that RegretA(H, T ) grows sublinearly with the number of rounds, T ,
which implies that the diﬀerence between the error rate of the learner and the
best hypothesis in H tends to zero as T goes to inﬁnity.
We ﬁrst show that this is an impossible mission—no algorithm can obtain a
sublinear regret bound even if |H| = 2. Indeed, consider H = {h0, h1}, where h0
is the function that always returns 0 and h1 is the function that always returns
1. An adversary can make the number of mistakes of any online algorithm be
equal to T , by simply waiting for the learner’s prediction and then providing
the opposite label as the true label. In contrast, for any sequence of true labels,
y1, . . . , yT , let b be the majority of labels in y1, . . . , yT , then the number of
mistakes of hb is at most T /2. Therefore, the regret of any online algorithm
might be at least T − T /2 = T /2, which is not sublinear in T . This impossibility
result is attributed to Cover (Cover 1965).

To sidestep Cover’s impossibility result, we must further restrict the power
of the adversarial environment. We do so by allowing the learner to randomize
his predictions. Of course, this by itself does not circumvent Cover’s impossibil-
ity result, since in deriving this result we assumed nothing about the learner’s
strategy. To make the randomization meaningful, we force the adversarial envir-
onment to decide on yt without knowing the random coins ﬂipped by the learner
on round t. The adversary can still know the learner’s forecasting strategy and
even the random coin ﬂips of previous rounds, but it does not know the actual
value of the random coin ﬂips used by the learner on round t. With this (mild)
change of game, we analyze the expected number of mistakes of the algorithm,
where the expectation is with respect to the learner’s own randomization. That
is, if the learner outputs ˆyt where P[ˆyt = 1] = pt, then the expected loss he pays

21.2 Online Classiﬁcation in the Unrealizable Case

295

on round t is

P[ˆyt (cid:54)= yt] = |pt − yt|.

Put another way, instead of having the predictions of the learner being in {0, 1}
we allow them to be in [0, 1], and interpret pt ∈ [0, 1] as the probability to predict
the label 1 on round t.

With this assumption it is possible to derive a low regret algorithm. In partic-

ular, we will prove the following theorem.

theorem 21.10 For every hypothesis class H, there exists an algorithm for
online classiﬁcation, whose predictions come from [0, 1], that enjoys the regret
bound

Furthermore, no algorithm can achieve an expected regret bound smaller than

.

We will provide a constructive proof of the upper bound part of the preceding
theorem. The proof of the lower bound part can be found in (Ben-David, Pal, &
Shalev-Shwartz 2009).

The proof of Theorem 21.10 relies on the Weighted-Majority algorithm for
learning with expert advice. This algorithm is important by itself and we dedicate
the next subsection to it.

21.2.1 Weighted-Majority

i = 1, and choosing the ith expert with probability w(t)

Weighted-majority is an algorithm for the problem of prediction with expert ad-
vice. In this online learning problem, on round t the learner has to choose the
advice of d given experts. We also allow the learner to randomize his choice by
deﬁning a distribution over the d experts, that is, picking a vector w(t) ∈ [0, 1]d,
. After the
learner chooses an expert, it receives a vector of costs, vt ∈ [0, 1]d, where vt,i
is the cost of following the advice of the ith expert. If the learner’s predic-
tions are randomized, then its loss is deﬁned to be the averaged cost, namely,
i vt,i = (cid:104)w(t), vt(cid:105). The algorithm assumes that the number of rounds T is
given. In Exercise 4 we show how to get rid of this dependence using the doubling
trick.

Proof of Theorem 21.10

Equipped with the Weighted-Majority algorithm and Theorem 21.11, we are
ready to prove Theorem 21.10. We start with the simpler case, in which H is
a ﬁnite class, and let us write H = {h1, . . . , hd}. In this case, we can refer to
each hypothesis, hi, as an expert, whose advice is to predict hi(xt), and whose
cost is vt,i = |hi(xt) − yt|. The prediction of the algorithm will therefore be

i hi(xt) ∈ [0, 1], and the loss is

Now, if yt = 1, then for all i, hi(xt) − yt ≤ 0. Therefore, the above equals to
|hi(xt) − yt|. If yt = 0 then for all i, hi(xt) − yt ≥ 0, and the above also
i w(t)

|hi(xt) − yt|. All in all, we have shown that

corollary 21.12 Let H be a ﬁnite hypothesis class. There exists an algorithm
for online classiﬁcation, whose predictions come from [0, 1], that enjoys the regret

Next, we consider the case of a general hypothesis class. Previously, we con-
structed an expert for each individual hypothesis. However, if H is inﬁnite this
leads to a vacuous bound. The main idea is to construct a set of experts in a
more sophisticated way. The challenge is how to deﬁne a set of experts that, on
one hand, is not excessively large and, on the other hand, contains experts that
give accurate predictions.

We construct the set of experts so that for each hypothesis h ∈ H and every
sequence of instances, x1, x2, . . . , xT , there exists at least one expert in the set
which behaves exactly as h on these instances. For each L ≤ Ldim(H) and each
sequence 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ··· < iL ≤ T we deﬁne an expert. The expert simulates
the game between SOA (presented in the previous section) and the environment
on the sequence of instances x1, x2, . . . , xT assuming that SOA makes a mistake
precisely in rounds i1, i2, . . . , iL. The expert is deﬁned by the following algorithm.

Expert(i1, i2, . . . , iL)

input A hypothesis class H ; Indices i1 < i2 < ··· < iL

else

update Vt+1 = V (ˆyt)

t

Note that each such expert can give us predictions at every round t while only
observing the instances x1, . . . , xt. Our generic online learning algorithm is now
an application of the Weighted-Majority algorithm with these experts.

To analyze the algorithm we ﬁrst note that the number of experts is

It can be shown that when T ≥ Ldim(H) + 2, the right-hand side of the equation
is bounded by (eT /Ldim(H))Ldim(H) (the proof can be found in Lemma A.5).

is at most the number of mistakes of the best expert plus(cid:112)2 log(d) T . We will

Theorem 21.11 tells us that the expected number of mistakes of Weighted-Majority

next show that the number of mistakes of the best expert is at most the number
of mistakes of the best hypothesis in H. The following key lemma shows that,
on any sequence of instances, for each hypothesis h ∈ H there exists an expert
with the same behavior.

lemma 21.13 Let H be any hypothesis class with Ldim(H) < ∞. Let x1, x2, . . . , xT
be any sequence of instances. For any h ∈ H, there exists L ≤ Ldim(H) and in-
dices 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ··· < iL ≤ T such that when running Expert(i1, i2, . . . , iL)
on the sequence x1, x2, . . . , xT , the expert predicts h(xt) on each online round
t = 1, 2, . . . , T .

Proof Fix h ∈ H and the sequence x1, x2, . . . , xT . We must construct L and the
indices i1, i2, . . . , iL. Consider running SOA on the input (x1, h(x1)), (x2, h(x2)),
. . ., (xT , h(xT )). SOA makes at most Ldim(H) mistakes on such input. We deﬁne
L to be the number of mistakes made by SOA and we deﬁne {i1, i2, . . . , iL} to
be the set of rounds in which SOA made the mistakes.

Now, consider the Expert(i1, i2, . . . , iL) running on the sequence x1, x2, . . . , xT .
By construction, the set Vt maintained by Expert(i1, i2, . . . , iL) equals the set Vt
maintained by SOA when running on the sequence (x1, h(x1)), . . . , (xT , h(xT )).
The predictions of SOA diﬀer from the predictions of h if and only if the round is
in {i1, i2, . . . , iL}. Since Expert(i1, i2, . . . , iL) predicts exactly like SOA if t is not
in {i1, i2, . . . , iL} and the opposite of SOAs’ predictions if t is in {i1, i2, . . . , iL},
we conclude that the predictions of the expert are always the same as the pre-
dictions of h.

The previous lemma holds in particular for the hypothesis in H that makes the
least number of mistakes on the sequence of examples, and we therefore obtain
the following:

corollary 21.14 Let (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xT , yT ) be a sequence of examples
and let H be a hypothesis class with Ldim(H) < ∞. There exists L ≤ Ldim(H)
and indices 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ··· < iL ≤ T , such that Expert(i1, i2, . . . , iL) makes
at most as many mistakes as the best h ∈ H does, namely,

T(cid:88)

Together with Theorem 21.11, the upper bound part of Theorem 21.10 is

Online Convex Optimization

In Chapter 12 we studied convex learning problems and showed learnability
results for these problems in the agnostic PAC learning framework. In this section
we show that similar learnability results hold for convex problems in the online
learning framework. In particular, we consider the following problem.

As in the online classiﬁcation problem, we analyze the regret of the algorithm.
Recall that the regret of an online algorithm with respect to a competing hy-
pothesis, which here will be some vector w(cid:63) ∈ H, is deﬁned as

T(cid:88)

The Online Perceptron Algorithm

The Perceptron is a classic online learning algorithm for binary classiﬁcation with
the hypothesis class of homogenous halfspaces, namely, H = {x (cid:55)→ sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) :

302

Online Learning

w ∈ Rd}. In Section 9.1.2 we have presented the batch version of the Perceptron,
which aims to solve the ERM problem with respect to H. We now present an
online version of the Perceptron algorithm.
Let X = Rd, Y = {−1, 1}. On round t, the learner receives a vector xt ∈ Rd.
The learner maintains a weight vector w(t) ∈ Rd and predicts pt = sign((cid:104)w(t), xt(cid:105)).
Then, it receives yt ∈ Y and pays 1 if pt (cid:54)= yt and 0 otherwise.

The goal of the learner is to make as few prediction mistakes as possible. In
Section 21.1 we characterized the optimal algorithm and showed that the best
achievable mistake bound depends on the Littlestone dimension of the class.
We show later that if d ≥ 2 then Ldim(H) = ∞, which implies that we have
no hope of making few prediction mistakes. Indeed, consider the tree for which
v1 = ( 1
4 , 1, 0, . . . , 0), etc. Because of
the density of the reals, this tree is shattered by the subset of H which contains
all hypotheses that are parametrized by w of the form w = (−1, a, 0, . . . , 0), for
a ∈ [0, 1]. We conclude that indeed Ldim(H) = ∞.

4 , 1, 0, . . . , 0), v3 = ( 3

2 , 1, 0, . . . , 0), v2 = ( 1

To sidestep this impossibility result, the Perceptron algorithm relies on the
technique of surrogate convex losses (see Section 12.3). This is also closely related
to the notion of margin we studied in Chapter 15.

A weight vector w makes a mistake on an example (x, y) whenever the sign of
(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) does not equal y. Therefore, we can write the 0−1 loss function as follows

(cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = 1[y(cid:104)w,x(cid:105)≤0].

On rounds on which the algorithm makes a prediction mistake, we shall use the
hinge-loss as a surrogate convex loss function

ft(w) = max{0, 1 − yt(cid:104)w, xt(cid:105)}.

The hinge-loss satisﬁes the two conditions:
• ft is a convex function
• For all w, ft(w) ≥ (cid:96)(w, (xt, yt)). In particular, this holds for w(t).

On rounds on which the algorithm is correct, we shall deﬁne ft(w) = 0. Clearly,
ft is convex in this case as well. Furthermore, ft(w(t)) = (cid:96)(w(t), (xt, yt)) = 0.
Remark 21.5
In Section 12.3 we used the same surrogate loss function for all the
examples. In the online model, we allow the surrogate to depend on the speciﬁc
round. It can even depend on w(t). Our ability to use a round speciﬁc surrogate
stems from the worst-case type of analysis we employ in online learning.

Let us now run the Online Gradient Descent algorithm on the sequence of
functions, f1, . . . , fT , with the hypothesis class being all vectors in Rd (hence,
the projection step is vacuous). Recall that the algorithm initializes w(1) = 0
and its update rule is

w(t+1) = w(t) − ηvt

for some vt ∈ ∂ft(w(t)). In our case, if yt(cid:104)w(t), xt(cid:105) > 0 then ft is the zero

21.4 The Online Perceptron Algorithm

function and we can take vt = 0. Otherwise, it is easy to verify that vt = −ytxt
is in ∂ft(w(t)). We therefore obtain the update rule

(cid:40)

w(t+1) =

w(t)
w(t) + ηytxt

if yt(cid:104)w(t), xt(cid:105) > 0
otherwise

Denote by M the set of rounds in which sign((cid:104)w(t), xt(cid:105)) (cid:54)= yt. Note that on

This form implies that the predictions of the Perceptron algorithm and the set
M do not depend on the actual value of η as long as η > 0. We have therefore
obtained the Perceptron algorithm:

initialize: w1 = 0
for t = 1, 2, . . . , T

predict pt = sign((cid:104)w(t), xt(cid:105))
if yt(cid:104)w(t), xt(cid:105) ≤ 0
w(t+1) = w(t) + ytxt

else

w(t+1) = w(t)

To analyze the Perceptron, we rely on the analysis of Online Gradient De-
scent given in the previous section. In our case, the subgradient of ft we use
in the Perceptron is vt = −1
[yt(cid:104)w(t),xt(cid:105)≤0] yt xt. Indeed, the Perceptron’s update
is w(t+1) = w(t) − vt, and as discussed before this is equivalent to w(t+1) =
w(t) − ηvt for every η > 0. Therefore, Theorem 21.15 tells us that

Suppose that the Perceptron algorithm runs on a sequence
(x1, y1), . . . , (xT , yT ) and let R = maxt (cid:107)xt(cid:107). Let M be the rounds on which the

last claim can be easily derived by analyzing the roots of the convex parabola
Q(y) = y2 − by − c.

The last assumption of Theorem 21.16 is called separability with large margin
(see Chapter 15). That is, there exists w(cid:63) that not only satisﬁes that the point
xt lies on the correct side of the halfspace, it also guarantees that xt is not too
close to the decision boundary. More speciﬁcally, the distance from xt to the
decision boundary is at least γ = 1/(cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107) and the bound becomes (R/γ)2.
When the separability assumption does not hold, the bound involves the term
[1 − yt(cid:104)w(cid:63), xt(cid:105)]+ which measures how much the separability with margin require-
ment is violated.

As a last remark we note that there can be cases in which there exists some
w(cid:63) that makes zero errors on the sequence but the Perceptron will make many
errors. Indeed, this is a direct consequence of the fact that Ldim(H) = ∞. The
way we sidestep this impossibility result is by assuming more on the sequence of
examples – the bound in Theorem 21.16 will be meaningful only if the cumulative

surrogate loss,(cid:80)

t ft(w(cid:63)) is not excessively large.

Summary

In this chapter we have studied the online learning model. Many of the results
we derived for the PAC learning model have an analog in the online model. First,
we have shown that a combinatorial dimension, the Littlestone dimension, char-
acterizes online learnability. To show this, we introduced the SOA algorithm (for
the realizable case) and the Weighted-Majority algorithm (for the unrealizable
case). We have also studied online convex optimization and have shown that
online gradient descent is a successful online learner whenever the loss function
is convex and Lipschitz. Finally, we presented the online Perceptron algorithm
as a combination of online gradient descent and the concept of surrogate convex
loss functions.

Bibliographic Remarks

The Standard Optimal Algorithm was derived by the seminal work of Lit-
tlestone (1988). A generalization to the nonrealizable case, as well as other
variants like margin-based Littlestone’s dimension, were derived in (Ben-David
et al. 2009). Characterizations of online learnability beyond classiﬁcation have
been obtained in (Abernethy, Bartlett, Rakhlin & Tewari 2008, Rakhlin, Srid-
haran & Tewari 2010, Daniely et al. 2011). The Weighted-Majority algorithm is
due to (Littlestone & Warmuth 1994) and (Vovk 1990).

The term “online convex programming” was introduced by Zinkevich (2003)
but this setting was introduced some years earlier by Gordon (1999). The Per-
ceptron dates back to Rosenblatt (Rosenblatt 1958). An analysis for the re-
alizable case (with margin assumptions) appears in (Agmon 1954, Minsky &
Papert 1969). Freund and Schapire (Freund & Schapire 1999) presented an anal-
ysis for the unrealizable case with a squared-hinge-loss based on a reduction to
the realizable case. A direct analysis for the unrealizable case with the hinge-loss
was given by Gentile (Gentile 2003).

and Shalev-Shwartz (2011).

its parameters require the knowledge of T . The doubling trick, described in
the following, enables us to convert such an algorithm into an algorithm that
does not need to know the time horizon. The idea is to divide the time into
periods of increasing size and run the original algorithm on each period.

22 Clustering

Clustering is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data anal-
ysis. Across all disciplines, from social sciences to biology to computer science,
people try to get a ﬁrst intuition about their data by identifying meaningful
groups among the data points. For example, computational biologists cluster
genes on the basis of similarities in their expression in diﬀerent experiments; re-
tailers cluster customers, on the basis of their customer proﬁles, for the purpose
of targeted marketing; and astronomers cluster stars on the basis of their spacial
proximity.

The ﬁrst point that one should clarify is, naturally, what is clustering? In-
tuitively, clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects such that similar
objects end up in the same group and dissimilar objects are separated into dif-
ferent groups. Clearly, this description is quite imprecise and possibly ambiguous.
Quite surprisingly, it is not at all clear how to come up with a more rigorous
deﬁnition.

There are several sources for this diﬃculty. One basic problem is that the
two objectives mentioned in the earlier statement may in many cases contradict
each other. Mathematically speaking, similarity (or proximity) is not a transi-
tive relation, while cluster sharing is an equivalence relation and, in particular,
it is a transitive relation. More concretely, it may be the case that there is a
long sequence of objects, x1, . . . , xm such that each xi is very similar to its two
neighbors, xi−1 and xi+1, but x1 and xm are very dissimilar. If we wish to make
sure that whenever two elements are similar they share the same cluster, then
we must put all of the elements of the sequence in the same cluster. However,
in that case, we end up with dissimilar elements (x1 and xm) sharing a cluster,
thus violating the second requirement.

To illustrate this point further, suppose that we would like to cluster the points

in the following picture into two clusters.

A clustering algorithm that emphasizes not separating close-by points (e.g., the
Single Linkage algorithm that will be described in Section 22.1) will cluster this
input by separating it horizontally according to the two lines:

Clustering

In contrast, a clustering method that emphasizes not having far-away points
share the same cluster (e.g., the 2-means algorithm that will be described in
Section 22.1) will cluster the same input by dividing it vertically into the right-
hand half and the left-hand half:

Another basic problem is the lack of “ground truth” for clustering, which is a
common problem in unsupervised learning. So far in the book, we have mainly
dealt with supervised learning (e.g., the problem of learning a classiﬁer from
labeled training data). The goal of supervised learning is clear – we wish to
learn a classiﬁer which will predict the labels of future examples as accurately
as possible. Furthermore, a supervised learner can estimate the success, or the
risk, of its hypotheses using the labeled training data by computing the empirical
loss. In contrast, clustering is an unsupervised learning problem; namely, there
are no labels that we try to predict. Instead, we wish to organize the data in
some meaningful way. As a result, there is no clear success evaluation procedure
for clustering. In fact, even on the basis of full knowledge of the underlying data
distribution, it is not clear what is the “correct” clustering for that data or how
to evaluate a proposed clustering.

Consider, for example, the following set of points in R2:

and suppose we are required to cluster them into two clusters. We have two
highly justiﬁable solutions:

Clustering

309

This phenomenon is not just artiﬁcial but occurs in real applications. A given
set of objects can be clustered in various diﬀerent meaningful ways. This may
be due to having diﬀerent implicit notions of distance (or similarity) between
objects, for example, clustering recordings of speech by the accent of the speaker
versus clustering them by content, clustering movie reviews by movie topic versus
clustering them by the review sentiment, clustering paintings by topic versus
clustering them by style, and so on.

To summarize, there may be several very diﬀerent conceivable clustering so-
lutions for a given data set. As a result, there is a wide variety of clustering
algorithms that, on some input data, will output very diﬀerent clusterings.

A Clustering Model:
Clustering tasks can vary in terms of both the type of input they have and the
type of outcome they are expected to compute. For concreteness, we shall focus
on the following common setup:

where(cid:83)k

Input — a set of elements, X , and a distance function over it. That is, a function
d : X × X → R+ that is symmetric, satisﬁes d(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈ X
and often also satisﬁes the triangle inequality. Alternatively, the function
could be a similarity function s : X × X → [0, 1] that is symmetric
and satisﬁes s(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ X . Additionally, some clustering
algorithms also require an input parameter k (determining the number
of required clusters).

Output — a partition of the domain set X into subsets. That is, C = (C1, . . . Ck)
i=1 Ci = X and for all i (cid:54)= j, Ci ∩ Cj = ∅. In some situations the
clustering is “soft,” namely, the partition of X into the diﬀerent clusters
is probabilistic where the output is a function assigning to each domain
point, x ∈ X , a vector (p1(x), . . . , pk(x)), where pi(x) = P[x ∈ Ci] is
the probability that x belongs to cluster Ci. Another possible output is
a clustering dendrogram (from Greek dendron = tree, gramma = draw-
ing), which is a hierarchical tree of domain subsets, having the singleton
sets in its leaves, and the full domain as its root. We shall discuss this
formulation in more detail in the following.

310

Clustering

In the following we survey some of the most popular clustering methods. In
the last section of this chapter we return to the high level discussion of what is
clustering.

22.1

Linkage-Based Clustering Algorithms

Linkage-based clustering is probably the simplest and most straightforward paradigm
of clustering. These algorithms proceed in a sequence of rounds. They start from
the trivial clustering that has each data point as a single-point cluster. Then,
repeatedly, these algorithms merge the “closest” clusters of the previous cluster-
ing. Consequently, the number of clusters decreases with each such round. If kept
going, such algorithms would eventually result in the trivial clustering in which
all of the domain points share one large cluster. Two parameters, then, need to
be determined to deﬁne such an algorithm clearly. First, we have to decide how
to measure (or deﬁne) the distance between clusters, and, second, we have to
determine when to stop merging. Recall that the input to a clustering algorithm
is a between-points distance function, d. There are many ways of extending d to
a measure of distance between domain subsets (or clusters). The most common
ways are

1. Single Linkage clustering, in which the between-clusters distance is deﬁned

by the minimum distance between members of the two clusters, namely,

D(A, B) def= min{d(x, y) : x ∈ A, y ∈ B}

2. Average Linkage clustering, in which the distance between two clusters is
deﬁned to be the average distance between a point in one of the clusters and
a point in the other, namely,

(cid:88)

D(A, B) def=

1

|A||B|

d(x, y)

x∈A, y∈B

3. Max Linkage clustering, in which the distance between two clusters is deﬁned

as the maximum distance between their elements, namely,
D(A, B) def= max{d(x, y) : x ∈ A, y ∈ B}.

The linkage-based clustering algorithms are agglomerative in the sense that they
start from data that is completely fragmented and keep building larger and
larger clusters as they proceed. Without employing a stopping rule, the outcome
of such an algorithm can be described by a clustering dendrogram: that is, a tree
of domain subsets, having the singleton sets in its leaves, and the full domain as
its root. For example, if the input is the elements X = {a, b, c, d, e} ⊂ R2 with
the Euclidean distance as depicted on the left, then the resulting dendrogram is
the one depicted on the right:

{d}

{e}

The single linkage algorithm is closely related to Kruskal’s algorithm for ﬁnding
a minimal spanning tree on a weighted graph. Indeed, consider the full graph
whose vertices are elements of X and the weight of an edge (x, y) is the distance
d(x, y). Each merge of two clusters performed by the single linkage algorithm
corresponds to a choice of an edge in the aforementioned graph. It is also possible
to show that the set of edges the single linkage algorithm chooses along its run
forms a minimal spanning tree.

If one wishes to turn a dendrogram into a partition of the space (a clustering),

one needs to employ a stopping criterion. Common stopping criteria include
• Fixed number of clusters – ﬁx some parameter, k, and stop merging clusters

as soon as the number of clusters is k.

• Distance upper bound – ﬁx some r ∈ R+. Stop merging as soon as all the
between-clusters distances are larger than r. We can also set r to be
α max{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ X} for some α < 1. In that case the stopping
criterion is called “scaled distance upper bound.”

22.2

k-Means and Other Cost Minimization Clusterings

Another popular approach to clustering starts by deﬁning a cost function over a
parameterized set of possible clusterings and the goal of the clustering algorithm
is to ﬁnd a partitioning (clustering) of minimal cost. Under this paradigm, the
clustering task is turned into an optimization problem. The objective function
is a function from pairs of an input, (X , d), and a proposed clustering solution
C = (C1, . . . , Ck), to positive real numbers. Given such an objective function,
which we denote by G, the goal of a clustering algorithm is deﬁned as ﬁnding, for
a given input (X , d), a clustering C so that G((X , d), C) is minimized. In order
to reach that goal, one has to apply some appropriate search algorithm.

As it turns out, most of the resulting optimization problems are NP-hard, and
some are even NP-hard to approximate. Consequently, when people talk about,
say, k-means clustering, they often refer to some particular common approxima-
tion algorithm rather than the cost function or the corresponding exact solution
of the minimization problem.

Many common objective functions require the number of clusters, k, as a

312

Clustering

parameter. In practice, it is often up to the user of the clustering algorithm to
choose the parameter k that is most suitable for the given clustering problem.
In the following we describe some of the most common objective functions.

• The k-means objective function is one of the most popular clustering
objectives. In k-means the data is partitioned into disjoint sets C1, . . . , Ck
where each Ci is represented by a centroid µi. It is assumed that the input
set X is embedded in some larger metric space (X (cid:48), d) (so that X ⊆ X (cid:48))
and centroids are members of X (cid:48). The k-means objective function measures
the squared distance between each point in X to the centroid of its cluster.
The centroid of Ci is deﬁned to be

(cid:88)

x∈Ci

µi(Ci) = argmin
µ∈X (cid:48)

d(x, µ)2.

Then, the k-means objective is

Gk−means((X , d), (C1, . . . , Ck)) =

d(x, µi(Ci))2.

This can also be rewritten as

Gk−means((X , d), (C1, . . . , Ck)) = min

µ1,...µk∈X (cid:48)

d(x, µi)2.

(22.1)

k(cid:88)

i=1

x∈Ci

(cid:88)
k(cid:88)

(cid:88)

i=1

x∈Ci

The k-means objective function is relevant, for example, in digital com-
munication tasks, where the members of X may be viewed as a collection
of signals that have to be transmitted. While X may be a very large set
of real valued vectors, digital transmission allows transmitting of only a
ﬁnite number of bits for each signal. One way to achieve good transmis-
sion under such constraints is to represent each member of X by a “close”
member of some ﬁnite set µ1, . . . µk, and replace the transmission of any
x ∈ X by transmitting the index of the closest µi. The k-means objective
can be viewed as a measure of the distortion created by such a transmission
representation scheme.
• The k-medoids objective function is similar to the k-means objective,
except that it requires the cluster centroids to be members of the input
set. The objective function is deﬁned by

GK−medoid((X , d), (C1, . . . , Ck)) = min

µ1,...µk∈X

d(x, µi)2.

• The k-median objective function is quite similar to the k-medoids objec-
tive, except that the “distortion” between a data point and the centroid
of its cluster is measured by distance, rather than by the square of the
distance:

GK−median((X , d), (C1, . . . , Ck)) = min

µ1,...µk∈X

d(x, µi).

An example where such an objective makes sense is the facility location
problem. Consider the task of locating k ﬁre stations in a city. One can
model houses as data points and aim to place the stations so as to minimize
the average distance between a house and its closest ﬁre station.

The previous examples can all be viewed as center-based objectives. The so-
lution to such a clustering problem is determined by a set of cluster centers,
and the clustering assigns each instance to the center closest to it. More gener-
ally, center-based objective is determined by choosing some monotonic function
f : R+ → R+ and then deﬁning

Some objective functions are not center based. For example, the sum of in-

Gf ((X , d), (C1, . . . Ck)) = min

where X (cid:48) is either X or some superset of X .

and the MinCut objective that we shall discuss in Section 22.3 are not center-

22.2.1

The k-Means Algorithm

The k-means objective function is quite popular in practical applications of clus-
tering. However, it turns out that ﬁnding the optimal k-means solution is of-
ten computationally infeasible (the problem is NP-hard, and even NP-hard to
approximate to within some constant). As an alternative, the following simple
iterative algorithm is often used, so often that, in many cases, the term k-means
Clustering refers to the outcome of this algorithm rather than to the cluster-
ing that minimizes the k-means objective cost. We describe the algorithm with
respect to the Euclidean distance function d(x, y) = (cid:107)x − y(cid:107).

gorithm needs in order to reach convergence. Furthermore, there is no nontrivial
lower bound on the gap between the value of the k-means objective of the al-
gorithm’s output and the minimum possible value of that objective function. In
fact, k-means might converge to a point which is not even a local minimum (see
Exercise 2). To improve the results of k-means it is often recommended to repeat
the procedure several times with diﬀerent randomly chosen initial centroids (e.g.,
we can choose the initial centroids to be random points from the data).

22.3

Spectral Clustering

Often, a convenient way to represent the relationships between points in a data
set X = {x1, . . . , xm} is by a similarity graph; each vertex represents a data
point xi, and every two vertices are connected by an edge whose weight is their
similarity, Wi,j = s(xi, xj), where W ∈ Rm,m. For example, we can set Wi,j =
exp(−d(xi, xj)2/σ2), where d(·,·) is a distance function and σ is a parameter.
The clustering problem can now be formulated as follows: We want to ﬁnd a
partition of the graph such that the edges between diﬀerent groups have low
weights and the edges within a group have high weights.

In the clustering objectives described previously, the focus was on one side
of our intuitive deﬁnition of clustering – making sure that points in the same
cluster are similar. We now present objectives that focus on the other requirement
– points separated into diﬀerent clusters should be nonsimilar.

22.3.1

Graph Cut

Given a graph represented by a similarity matrix W , the simplest and most
direct way to construct a partition of the graph is to solve the mincut problem,
which chooses a partition C1, . . . , Ck that minimizes the objective

cut(C1, . . . , Ck) =

Wr,s.

k(cid:88)

(cid:88)

i=1

r∈Ci,s /∈Ci

For k = 2, the mincut problem can be solved eﬃciently. However, in practice it
often does not lead to satisfactory partitions. The problem is that in many cases,
the solution of mincut simply separates one individual vertex from the rest of the
graph. Of course, this is not what we want to achieve in clustering, as clusters
should be reasonably large groups of points.

Several solutions to this problem have been suggested. The simplest solution

is to normalize the cut and deﬁne the normalized mincut objective as follows:

RatioCut(C1, . . . , Ck) =

(cid:88)

k(cid:88)

i=1

1
|Ci|

Wr,s.

r∈Ci,s /∈Ci

The preceding objective assumes smaller values if the clusters are not too small.
Unfortunately, introducing this balancing makes the problem computationally
hard to solve. Spectral clustering is a way to relax the problem of minimizing
RatioCut.

22.3.2

Graph Laplacian and Relaxed Graph Cuts

The main mathematical object for spectral clustering is the graph Laplacian
matrix. There are several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of graph Laplacian in the literature,
and in the following we describe one particular deﬁnition.

316

definition 22.2 (Unnormalized Graph Laplacian) The unnormalized graph
Laplacian is the m × m matrix L = D − W where D is a diagonal matrix with

j=1 Wi,j. The matrix D is called the degree matrix.

The following lemma underscores the relation between RatioCut and the Lapla-

cian matrix.

lemma 22.3 Let C1, . . . , Ck be a clustering and let H ∈ Rm,k be the matrix
such that

Hi,j = 1√

|Cj| 1[i∈Cj ].

Then, the columns of H are orthonormal to each other and

RatioCut(C1, . . . , Ck) = trace(H(cid:62) L H).

Proof Let h1, . . . , hk be the columns of H. The fact that these vectors are
orthonormal is immediate from the deﬁnition. Next, by standard algebraic ma-
i Lhi and that for

nipulations, it can be shown that trace(H(cid:62) L H) = (cid:80)k

Applying this with v = hi and noting that (hi,r − hi,s)2 is nonzero only if
r ∈ Ci, s /∈ Ci or the other way around, we obtain that

are orthonormal and such that each Hi,j is either 0 or 1/(cid:112)|Cj|. Unfortunately,

Therefore, to minimize RatioCut we can search for a matrix H whose columns

this is an integer programming problem which we cannot solve eﬃciently. Instead,
we relax the latter requirement and simply search an orthonormal matrix H ∈
Rm,k that minimizes trace(H(cid:62) L H). As we will see in the next chapter about
PCA (particularly, the proof of Theorem 23.2), the solution to this problem is
to set U to be the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors corresponding to
the k minimal eigenvalues of L. The resulting algorithm is called Unnormalized
Spectral Clustering.

Unnormalized Spectral Clustering

Input: W ∈ Rm,m ; Number of clusters k
Initialize: Compute the unnormalized graph Laplacian L
Let U ∈ Rm,k be the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of L

corresponding to the k smallest eigenvalues

Let v1, . . . , vm be the rows of U
Cluster the points v1, . . . , vm using k-means
Output: Clusters C1, . . . , CK of the k-means algorithm

The spectral clustering algorithm starts with ﬁnding the matrix H of the k
eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian
matrix. It then represents points according to the rows of H. It is due to the
properties of the graph Laplacians that this change of representation is useful.
In many situations, this change of representation enables the simple k-means
algorithm to detect the clusters seamlessly. Intuitively, if H is as deﬁned in
Lemma 22.3 then each point in the new representation is an indicator vector
whose value is nonzero only on the element corresponding to the cluster it belongs
to.

22.4

Information Bottleneck*

The information bottleneck method is a clustering technique introduced by
Tishby, Pereira, and Bialek. It relies on notions from information theory. To
illustrate the method, consider the problem of clustering text documents where
each document is represented as a bag-of-words; namely, each document is a
vector x = {0, 1}n, where n is the size of the dictionary and xi = 1 iﬀ the word
corresponding to index i appears in the document. Given a set of m documents,
we can interpret the bag-of-words representation of the m documents as a joint
probability over a random variable x, indicating the identity of a document (thus
taking values in [m]), and a random variable y, indicating the identity of a word
in the dictionary (thus taking values in [n]).

With this interpretation, the information bottleneck refers to the identity of
a clustering as another random variable, denoted C, that takes values in [k]
(where k will be set by the method as well). Once we have formulated x, y, C
as random variables, we can use tools from information theory to express a
clustering objective. In particular, the information bottleneck objective is

I(x; C) − βI(C; y) ,

min
p(C|x)

where I(·;·) is the mutual information between two random variables,1 β is a

Clustering

parameter, and the minimization is over all possible probabilistic assignments of
points to clusters. Intuitively, we would like to achieve two contradictory goals.
On one hand, we would like the mutual information between the identity of
the document and the identity of the cluster to be as small as possible. This
reﬂects the fact that we would like a strong compression of the original data. On
the other hand, we would like high mutual information between the clustering
variable and the identity of the words, which reﬂects the goal that the “relevant”
information about the document (as reﬂected by the words that appear in the
document) is retained. This generalizes the classical notion of minimal suﬃcient
statistics2 used in parametric statistics to arbitrary distributions.

Solving the optimization problem associated with the information bottleneck
principle is hard in the general case. Some of the proposed methods are similar
to the EM principle, which we will discuss in Chapter 24.

22.5

A High Level View of Clustering

So far, we have mainly listed various useful clustering tools. However, some fun-
damental questions remain unaddressed. First and foremost, what is clustering?
What is it that distinguishes a clustering algorithm from any arbitrary function
that takes an input space and outputs a partition of that space? Are there any
basic properties of clustering that are independent of any speciﬁc algorithm or
task?

One method for addressing such questions is via an axiomatic approach. There
have been several attempts to provide an axiomatic deﬁnition of clustering. Let
us demonstrate this approach by presenting the attempt made by Kleinberg
(2003).

Consider a clustering function, F , that takes as input any ﬁnite domain X

with a dissimilarity function d over its pairs and returns a partition of X .

Consider the following three properties of such a function:

Scale Invariance (SI) For any domain set X , dissimilarity function d, and
any α > 0, the following should hold: F (X , d) = F (X , αd) (where
(αd)(x, y) def= α d(x, y)).

Richness (Ri) For any ﬁnite X and every partition C = (C1, . . . Ck) of X (into
nonempty subsets) there exists some dissimilarity function d over X such
that F (X , d) = C.
I(x; C) =(cid:80)

, where the sum is over all values x can take and all

(cid:16) p(a,b)

(cid:80)

(cid:17)

a

b p(a, b) log

p(a)p(b)

values C can take.

2 A suﬃcient statistic is a function of the data which has the property of suﬃciency with
respect to a statistical model and its associated unknown parameter, meaning that “no
other statistic which can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional
information as to the value of the parameter.” For example, if we assume that a variable is
distributed normally with a unit variance and an unknown expectation, then the average
function is a suﬃcient statistic.

22.5 A High Level View of Clustering

319

Consistency (Co) If d and d(cid:48) are dissimilarity functions over X , such that
for every x, y ∈ X , if x, y belong to the same cluster in F (X , d) then
d(cid:48)(x, y) ≤ d(x, y) and if x, y belong to diﬀerent clusters in F (X , d) then
d(cid:48)(x, y) ≥ d(x, y), then F (X , d) = F (X , d(cid:48)).

A moment of reﬂection reveals that the Scale Invariance is a very natural
requirement – it would be odd to have the result of a clustering function depend
on the units used to measure between-point distances. The Richness requirement
basically states that the outcome of the clustering function is fully controlled by
the function d, which is also a very intuitive feature. The third requirement,
Consistency, is the only requirement that refers to the basic (informal) deﬁnition
of clustering – we wish that similar points will be clustered together and that
dissimilar points will be separated to diﬀerent clusters, and therefore, if points
that already share a cluster become more similar, and points that are already
separated become even less similar to each other, the clustering function should
have even stronger “support” of its previous clustering decisions.

However, Kleinberg (2003) has shown the following “impossibility” result:

theorem 22.4 There exists no function, F , that satisﬁes all the three proper-
ties: Scale Invariance, Richness, and Consistency.

Proof Assume, by way of contradiction, that some F does satisfy all three
properties. Pick some domain set X with at least three points. By Richness,
there must be some d1 such that F (X , d1) = {{x} : x ∈ X} and there also exists
some d2 such that F (X , d2) (cid:54)= F (X , d1).
Let α ∈ R+ be such that for every x, y ∈ X , αd2(x, y) ≥ d1(x, y). Let d3 =
αd2. Consider F (X , d3). By the Scale Invariance property of F , we should have
F (X , d3) = F (X , d2). On the other hand, since all distinct x, y ∈ X reside in
diﬀerent clusters w.r.t. F (X , d1), and d3(x, y) ≥ d1(x, y), the Consistency of F
implies that F (X , d3) = F (X , d1). This is a contradiction, since we chose d1, d2
so that F (X , d2) (cid:54)= F (X , d1).

It is important to note that there is no single “bad property” among the three
properties. For every pair of the the three axioms, there exist natural clustering
functions that satisfy the two properties in that pair (one can even construct such
examples just by varying the stopping criteria for the Single Linkage clustering
function). On the other hand, Kleinberg shows that any clustering algorithm
that minimizes any center-based objective function inevitably fails the consis-
tency property (yet, the k-sum-of-in-cluster-distances minimization clustering
does satisfy Consistency).

The Kleinberg impossibility result can be easily circumvented by varying the
properties. For example, if one wishes to discuss clustering functions that have
a ﬁxed number-of-clusters parameter, then it is natural to replace Richness by
k-Richness (namely, the requirement that every partition of the domain into k
subsets is attainable by the clustering function). k-Richness, Scale Invariance
and Consistency all hold for the k-means clustering and are therefore consistent.

320

Clustering

1, . . . C(cid:48)
j or C(cid:48)

Alternatively, one can relax the Consistency property. For example, say that two
clusterings C = (C1, . . . Ck) and C(cid:48) = (C(cid:48)
l) are compatible if for every
clusters Ci ∈ C and C(cid:48)
j ∈ C(cid:48), either Ci ⊆ C(cid:48)
j ⊆ Ci or Ci ∩ C(cid:48)
j = ∅ (it is
worthwhile noting that for every dendrogram, every two clusterings that are ob-
tained by trimming that dendrogram are compatible). “Reﬁnement Consistency”
is the requirement that, under the assumptions of the Consistency property, the
new clustering F (X , d(cid:48)) is compatible with the old clustering F (X , d). Many
common clustering functions satisfy this requirement as well as Scale Invariance
and Richness. Furthermore, one can come up with many other, diﬀerent, prop-
erties of clustering functions that sound intuitive and desirable and are satisﬁed
by some common clustering functions.

There are many ways to interpret these results. We suggest to view it as indi-
cating that there is no “ideal” clustering function. Every clustering function will
inevitably have some “undesirable” properties. The choice of a clustering func-
tion for any given task must therefore take into account the speciﬁc properties
of that task. There is no generic clustering solution, just as there is no clas-
siﬁcation algorithm that will learn every learnable task (as the No-Free-Lunch
theorem shows). Clustering, just like classiﬁcation prediction, must take into
account some prior knowledge about the speciﬁc task at hand.

22.6

Summary

Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem, in which we wish to partition
a set of points into “meaningful” subsets. We presented several clustering ap-
proaches including linkage-based algorithms, the k-means family, spectral clus-
tering, and the information bottleneck. We discussed the diﬃculty of formalizing
the intuitive meaning of clustering.

22.7

Bibliographic Remarks

The k-means algorithm is sometimes named Lloyd’s algorithm, after Stuart
Lloyd, who proposed the method in 1957. For a more complete overview of
spectral clustering we refer the reader to the excellent tutorial by Von Luxburg
(2007). The information bottleneck method was introduced by Tishby, Pereira
& Bialek (1999). For an additional discussion on the axiomatic approach see
Ackerman & Ben-David (2008).

OPT is the minimum k-means objective.

2. k-Means Might Not Necessarily Converge to a Local Minimum:
Show that the k-means algorithm might converge to a point which is not
a local minimum. Hint: Suppose that k = 2 and the sample points are
{1, 2, 3, 4} ⊂ R suppose we initialize the k-means with the centers {2, 4};
and suppose we break ties in the deﬁnition of Ci by assigning i to be the
smallest value in argminj (cid:107)x − µj(cid:107).
3. Given a metric space (X , d), where |X| < ∞, and k ∈ N, we would like to ﬁnd

where diam(Cj) = maxx,x(cid:48)∈Cj d(x, x(cid:48)) (we use the convention diam(Cj) = 0
if |Cj| < 2).

Similarly to the k-means objective, it is NP-hard to minimize the k-
diam objective. Fortunately, we have a very simple approximation algorithm:
Initially, we pick some x ∈ X and set µ1 = x. Then, the algorithm iteratively
sets

∀j ∈ {2, . . . , k}, µj = argmax

Finally, we set

∀i ∈ [k], Ci = {x ∈ X : i = argmin

Prove that the algorithm described is a 2-approximation algorithm. That
is, if we denote its output by ˆC1, . . . , ˆCk, and denote the optimal solution by

Hint: Consider the point µk+1 (in other words, the next center we would have
chosen, if we wanted k + 1 clusters). Let r = minj∈[k] d(µj, µk+1). Prove the

2. Find which of the three properties is satisﬁed by Single Linkage with the

Prove that, for every number k, there exists a clustering function that
satisﬁes the three properties: Scale Invariance, k-Richness, and Consistency.

23 Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is the process of taking data in a high dimensional
space and mapping it into a new space whose dimensionality is much smaller.
This process is closely related to the concept of (lossy) compression in infor-
mation theory. There are several reasons to reduce the dimensionality of the
data. First, high dimensional data impose computational challenges. Moreover,
in some situations high dimensionality might lead to poor generalization abili-
ties of the learning algorithm (for example, in Nearest Neighbor classiﬁers the
sample complexity increases exponentially with the dimension—see Chapter 19).
Finally, dimensionality reduction can be used for interpretability of the data, for
ﬁnding meaningful structure of the data, and for illustration purposes.

In this chapter we describe popular methods for dimensionality reduction. In
those methods, the reduction is performed by applying a linear transformation
to the original data. That is, if the original data is in Rd and we want to embed
it into Rn (n < d) then we would like to ﬁnd a matrix W ∈ Rn,d that induces
the mapping x (cid:55)→ W x. A natural criterion for choosing W is in a way that will
enable a reasonable recovery of the original x. It is not hard to show that in
general, exact recovery of x from W x is impossible (see Exercise 1).

The ﬁrst method we describe is called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
In PCA, both the compression and the recovery are performed by linear transfor-
mations and the method ﬁnds the linear transformations for which the diﬀerences
between the recovered vectors and the original vectors are minimal in the least
squared sense.

Next, we describe dimensionality reduction using random matrices W . We
derive an important lemma, often called the “Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma,”
which analyzes the distortion caused by such a random dimensionality reduction
technique.

Last, we show how one can reduce the dimension of all sparse vectors using
again a random matrix. This process is known as Compressed Sensing. In this
case, the recovery process is nonlinear but can still be implemented eﬃciently
using linear programming.

We conclude by underscoring the underlying “prior assumptions” behind PCA
and compressed sensing, which can help us understand the merits and pitfalls of
the two methods.

Dimensionality Reduction

23.1

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Let x1, . . . , xm be m vectors in Rd. We would like to reduce the dimensional-
ity of these vectors using a linear transformation. A matrix W ∈ Rn,d, where
n < d, induces a mapping x (cid:55)→ W x, where W x ∈ Rn is the lower dimensionality
representation of x. Then, a second matrix U ∈ Rd,n can be used to (approxi-
mately) recover each original vector x from its compressed version. That is, for
a compressed vector y = W x, where y is in the low dimensional space Rn, we
can construct ˜x = U y, so that ˜x is the recovered version of x and resides in the
original high dimensional space Rd.

In PCA, we ﬁnd the compression matrix W and the recovering matrix U so
that the total squared distance between the original and recovered vectors is
minimal; namely, we aim at solving the problem

2.

(23.1)

To solve this problem we ﬁrst show that the optimal solution takes a speciﬁc

form.

lemma 23.1 Let (U, W ) be a solution to Equation (23.1). Then the columns of
U are orthonormal (namely, U(cid:62)U is the identity matrix of Rn) and W = U(cid:62).
Proof Fix any U, W and consider the mapping x (cid:55)→ U W x. The range of this
mapping, R = {U W x : x ∈ Rd}, is an n dimensional linear subspace of Rd. Let
V ∈ Rd,n be a matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis of this subspace,
namely, the range of V is R and V (cid:62)V = I. Therefore, each vector in R can be
written as V y where y ∈ Rn. For every x ∈ Rd and y ∈ Rn we have

(cid:107)x − V y(cid:107)2

2 = (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 + y(cid:62)V (cid:62)V y − 2y(cid:62)V (cid:62)x = (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)y(cid:107)2 − 2y(cid:62)(V (cid:62)x),

where we used the fact that V (cid:62)V is the identity matrix of Rn. Minimizing the
preceding expression with respect to y by comparing the gradient with respect
to y to zero gives that y = V (cid:62)x. Therefore, for each x we have that

V V (cid:62)x = argmin
˜x∈R

(cid:107)x − ˜x(cid:107)2
2.

In particular this holds for x1, . . . , xm and therefore we can replace U, W by
V, V (cid:62) and by that do not increase the objective

Since this holds for every U, W the proof of the lemma follows.

On the basis of the preceding lemma, we can rewrite the optimization problem

given in Equation (23.1) as follows:

(23.2)

23.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We further simplify the optimization problem by using the following elementary
algebraic manipulations. For every x ∈ Rd and a matrix U ∈ Rd,n such that
U(cid:62)U = I we have

(cid:107)x − UU (cid:62)x(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 − 2x(cid:62)UU (cid:62)x + x(cid:62)U U(cid:62)UU (cid:62)x

= (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 − x(cid:62)UU (cid:62)x
= (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 − trace(U(cid:62)xx(cid:62)U ),

(23.3)

where the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries. Since the trace is
a linear operator, this allows us to rewrite Equation (23.2) as follows:

i . The matrix A is symmetric and therefore it can be
written using its spectral decomposition as A = VDV (cid:62), where D is diagonal and
V (cid:62)V = VV (cid:62) = I. Here, the elements on the diagonal of D are the eigenvalues of
A and the columns of V are the corresponding eigenvectors. We assume without
loss of generality that D1,1 ≥ D2,2 ≥ ··· ≥ Dd,d. Since A is positive semideﬁnite
it also holds that Dd,d ≥ 0. We claim that the solution to Equation (23.4) is
the matrix U whose columns are the n eigenvectors of A corresponding to the
largest n eigenvalues.

theorem 23.2 Let x1, . . . , xm be arbitrary vectors in Rd, let A =(cid:80)m

i=1 xix(cid:62)
i ,
and let u1, . . . , un be n eigenvectors of the matrix A corresponding to the largest
n eigenvalues of A. Then, the solution to the PCA optimization problem given
in Equation (23.1) is to set U to be the matrix whose columns are u1, . . . , un
and to set W = U(cid:62).
Proof Let VDV (cid:62) be the spectral decomposition of A. Fix some matrix U ∈ Rd,n

Remark 23.2
It is a common practice to “center” the examples before applying
PCA. That is, we ﬁrst calculate µ = 1
i=1 xi and then apply PCA on the
vectors (x1 − µ), . . . , (xm − µ). This is also related to the interpretation of PCA
m
as variance maximization (see Exercise 4).

23.1.1

A More Eﬃcient Solution for the Case d (cid:29) m

In some situations the original dimensionality of the data is much larger than
the number of examples m. The computational complexity of calculating the
PCA solution as described previously is O(d3) (for calculating eigenvalues of A)
plus O(md2) (for constructing the matrix A). We now show a simple trick that
enables us to calculate the PCA solution more eﬃciently when d (cid:29) m.

Recall that the matrix A is deﬁned to be(cid:80)m

i . It is convenient to rewrite
A = X(cid:62)X where X ∈ Rm,d is a matrix whose ith row is x(cid:62)
i . Consider the
matrix B = XX(cid:62). That is, B ∈ Rm,m is the matrix whose i, j element equals
(cid:104)xi, xj(cid:105). Suppose that u is an eigenvector of B: That is, Bu = λu for some
λ ∈ R. Multiplying the equality by X(cid:62) and using the deﬁnition of B we obtain
X(cid:62)XX(cid:62)u = λX(cid:62)u. But, using the deﬁnition of A, we get that A(X(cid:62)u) =
λ(X(cid:62)u). Thus, X(cid:62)u

(cid:107)X(cid:62)u(cid:107) is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue of λ.

i=1 xix(cid:62)

We can therefore calculate the PCA solution by calculating the eigenvalues of
B instead of A. The complexity is O(m3) (for calculating eigenvalues of B) and
m2d (for constructing the matrix B).

Remark 23.3 The previous discussion also implies that to calculate the PCA
solution we only need to know how to calculate inner products between vectors.
This enables us to calculate PCA implicitly even when d is very large (or even
inﬁnite) using kernels, which yields the kernel PCA algorithm.

To illustrate how PCA works, let us generate vectors in R2 that approximately
reside on a line, namely, on a one dimensional subspace of R2. For example,
suppose that each example is of the form (x, x + y) where x is chosen uniformly
at random from [−1, 1] and y is sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean
0 and standard deviation of 0.1. Suppose we apply PCA on this data. Then, the
eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue will be close to the vector
(1/
2). When projecting a point (x, x + y) on this principal component
we will obtain the scalar 2x+y√
. The reconstruction of the original vector will be
2
((x + y/2), (x + y/2)). In Figure 23.1 we depict the original versus reconstructed
data.

Next, we demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of PCA on a data set of faces. We
extracted images of faces from the Yale data set (Georghiades, Belhumeur &
Kriegman 2001). Each image contains 50×50 = 2500 pixels; therefore the original
dimensionality is very high.

Some images of faces are depicted on the top-left side of Figure 23.2. Using
PCA, we reduced the dimensionality to R10 and reconstructed back to the orig-
inal dimension, which is 502. The resulting reconstructed images are depicted
on the top-right side of Figure 23.2. Finally, on the bottom of Figure 23.2 we
depict a 2 dimensional representation of the images. As can be seen, even from a
2 dimensional representation of the images we can still roughly separate diﬀerent
individuals.

23.2 Random Projections

23.2

Random Projections

In this section we show that reducing the dimension by using a random linear
transformation leads to a simple compression scheme with a surprisingly low
distortion. The transformation x (cid:55)→ W x, when W is a random matrix, is often
referred to as a random projection. In particular, we provide a variant of a famous
lemma due to Johnson and Lindenstrauss, showing that random projections do
not distort Euclidean distances too much.

Let x1, x2 be two vectors in Rd. A matrix W does not distort too much the

distance between x1 and x2 if the ratio

(cid:107)W x1 − W x2(cid:107)

(cid:107)x1 − x2(cid:107)

is close to 1. In other words, the distances between x1 and x2 before and after
the transformation are almost the same. To show that (cid:107)W x1 − W x2(cid:107) is not too
far away from (cid:107)x1 − x2(cid:107) it suﬃces to show that W does not distort the norm of
the diﬀerence vector x = x1 − x2. Therefore, from now on we focus on the ratio
(cid:107)W x(cid:107)
(cid:107)x(cid:107) .
We start with analyzing the distortion caused by applying a random projection

to a single vector.

equivalent inequality is

able (cid:107)W x(cid:107)2 = (cid:80)n

Let wi be the ith row of W . The random variable (cid:104)wi, x(cid:105) is a weighted sum of
d independent normal random variables and therefore it is normally distributed
j = (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 = 1. Therefore, the random vari-

directly from a measure concentration property of χ2 random variables stated in

Interestingly, the bound given in Lemma 23.4 does not depend on the original
dimension of x. In fact, the bound holds even if x is in an inﬁnite dimensional
Hilbert space.

23.3

Compressed Sensing

Compressed sensing is a dimensionality reduction technique which utilizes a prior
assumption that the original vector is sparse in some basis. To motivate com-
pressed sensing, consider a vector x ∈ Rd that has at most s nonzero elements.
That is,

(cid:107)x(cid:107)0

def= |{i : xi (cid:54)= 0}| ≤ s.

Clearly, we can compress x by representing it using s (index,value) pairs. Fur-
thermore, this compression is lossless – we can reconstruct x exactly from the s
(index,value) pairs. Now, lets take one step forward and assume that x = U α,
where α is a sparse vector, (cid:107)α(cid:107)0 ≤ s, and U is a ﬁxed orthonormal matrix. That
is, x has a sparse representation in another basis. It turns out that many nat-
ural vectors are (at least approximately) sparse in some representation. In fact,
this assumption underlies many modern compression schemes. For example, the
JPEG-2000 format for image compression relies on the fact that natural images
are approximately sparse in a wavelet basis.

Can we still compress x into roughly s numbers? Well, one simple way to do
this is to multiply x by U(cid:62), which yields the sparse vector α, and then represent
α by its s (index,value) pairs. However, this requires us ﬁrst to “sense” x, to
store it, and then to multiply it by U(cid:62). This raises a very natural question: Why
go to so much eﬀort to acquire all the data when most of what we get will be
thrown away? Cannot we just directly measure the part that will not end up
being thrown away?

23.3 Compressed Sensing

331

Compressed sensing is a technique that simultaneously acquires and com-
presses the data. The key result is that a random linear transformation can
compress x without losing information. The number of measurements needed is
order of s log(d). That is, we roughly acquire only the important information
about the signal. As we will see later, the price we pay is a slower reconstruction
phase. In some situations, it makes sense to save time in compression even at
the price of a slower reconstruction. For example, a security camera should sense
and compress a large amount of images while most of the time we do not need to
decode the compressed data at all. Furthermore, in many practical applications,
compression by a linear transformation is advantageous because it can be per-
formed eﬃciently in hardware. For example, a team led by Baraniuk and Kelly
has proposed a camera architecture that employs a digital micromirror array to
perform optical calculations of a linear transformation of an image. In this case,
obtaining each compressed measurement is as easy as obtaining a single raw
measurement. Another important application of compressed sensing is medical
imaging, in which requiring fewer measurements translates to less radiation for
the patient.

Informally, the main premise of compressed sensing is the following three “sur-

prising” results:

1. It is possible to reconstruct any sparse signal fully if it was compressed by
x (cid:55)→ W x, where W is a matrix which satisﬁes a condition called the Re-
stricted Isoperimetric Property (RIP). A matrix that satisﬁes this property is
guaranteed to have a low distortion of the norm of any sparse representable
vector.

2. The reconstruction can be calculated in polynomial time by solving a linear

program.

3. A random n × d matrix is likely to satisfy the RIP condition provided that n

is greater than an order of s log(d).

Formally,

definition 23.5 (RIP) A matrix W ∈ Rn,d is (, s)-RIP if for all x (cid:54)= 0 s.t.
(cid:107)x(cid:107)0 ≤ s we have

(cid:107)x(cid:107)2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ .

The ﬁrst theorem establishes that RIP matrices yield a lossless compression
scheme for sparse vectors. It also provides a (noneﬃcient) reconstruction scheme.

theorem 23.6 Let  < 1 and let W be a (, 2s)-RIP matrix. Let x be a vector
s.t. (cid:107)x(cid:107)0 ≤ s, let y = W x be the compression of x, and let

˜x ∈ argmin

v:W v=y

(cid:107)v(cid:107)0

be a reconstructed vector. Then, ˜x = x.

332

Dimensionality Reduction

Proof We assume, by way of contradiction, that ˜x (cid:54)= x. Since x satisﬁes the
constraints in the optimization problem that deﬁnes ˜x we clearly have that
(cid:107)˜x(cid:107)0 ≤ (cid:107)x(cid:107)0 ≤ s. Therefore, (cid:107)x − ˜x(cid:107)0 ≤ 2s and we can apply the RIP in-
equality on the vector x − ˜x. But, since W (x − ˜x) = 0 we get that |0 − 1| ≤ ,
which leads to a contradiction.

The reconstruction scheme given in Theorem 23.6 seems to be noneﬃcient
because we need to minimize a combinatorial objective (the sparsity of v). Quite
surprisingly, it turns out that we can replace the combinatorial objective, (cid:107)v(cid:107)0,
with a convex objective, (cid:107)v(cid:107)1, which leads to a linear programming problem that
can be solved eﬃciently. This is stated formally in the following theorem.

0 elsewhere. Let y = W x be the compression of x and let

x(cid:63) ∈ argmin

Note that in the special case that x = xs we get an exact recovery, x(cid:63) = x, so
Theorem 23.7 is a special case of Theorem 23.8. The proof of Theorem 23.8 is
given in Section 23.3.1.

Finally, the third result tells us that random matrices with n ≥ Ω(s log(d)) are
likely to be RIP. In fact, the theorem shows that multiplying a random matrix
by an orthonormal matrix also provides an RIP matrix. This is important for
compressing signals of the form x = U α where x is not sparse but α is sparse.
In that case, if W is a random matrix and we compress using y = W x then this
is the same as compressing α by y = (W U )α and since W U is also RIP we can
reconstruct α (and thus also x) from y.

We follow a proof due to Cand`es (2008).
Let h = x(cid:63) − x. Given a vector v and a set of indices I we denote by vI the
vector whose ith element is vi if i ∈ I and 0 otherwise.
The ﬁrst trick we use is to partition the set of indices [d] = {1, . . . , d} into
disjoint sets of size s. That is, we will write [d] = T0 ·∪ T1 ·∪ T2 . . . Td/s−1 where
for all i, |Ti| = s, and we assume for simplicity that d/s is an integer. We deﬁne
the partition as follows. In T0 we put the s indices corresponding to the s largest

To prove the theorem we ﬁrst need the following lemma, which shows that

RIP also implies approximate orthogonality.

lemma 23.10 Let W be an (, 2s)-RIP matrix. Then, for any two disjoint sets
I, J, both of size at most s, and for any vector u we have that (cid:104)W uI , W uJ(cid:105) ≤
(cid:107)uI(cid:107)2 (cid:107)uJ(cid:107)2.
Proof W.l.o.g. assume (cid:107)uI(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)uJ(cid:107)2 = 1.

(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)hT0,1(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)hT c

Proving Claim 1:
To prove this claim we do not use the RIP condition at all but only use the fact
that x(cid:63) minimizes the (cid:96)1 norm. Take j > 1. For each i ∈ Tj and i(cid:48) ∈ Tj−1 we
have that |hi| ≤ |hi(cid:48)|. Therefore, (cid:107)hTj(cid:107)∞ ≤ (cid:107)hTj−1(cid:107)1/s. Thus,

(cid:107)hTj(cid:107)2 ≤ s1/2(cid:107)hTj(cid:107)∞ ≤ s−1/2(cid:107)hTj−1(cid:107)1.

we have that (cid:107)x(cid:107)1 ≥ (cid:107)x(cid:63)(cid:107)1 = (cid:107)x + h(cid:107)1. Thus, using the triangle inequality we

which concludes the proof of the second claim.

Proof of Theorem 23.9
To prove the theorem we follow an approach due to (Baraniuk, Davenport, De-
Vore & Wakin 2008). The idea is to combine the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL)
lemma with a simple covering argument.

We start with a covering property of the unit ball.

lemma 23.11 Let  ∈ (0, 1). There exists a ﬁnite set Q ⊂ Rd of size |Q| ≤(cid:0) 3

(cid:1)d



such that

sup

x:(cid:107)x(cid:107)≤1

min
v∈Q

(cid:107)x − v(cid:107) ≤ .

Proof Let k be an integer and let

Q(cid:48) = {x ∈ Rd : ∀j ∈ [d],∃i ∈ {−k,−k + 1, . . . , k} s.t. xj = i
k}.

Clearly, |Q(cid:48)| = (2k + 1)d. We shall set Q = Q(cid:48) ∩ B2(1), where B2(1) is the unit
(cid:96)2 ball of Rd. Since the points in Q(cid:48) are distributed evenly on the unit (cid:96)∞ ball,
the size of Q is the size of Q(cid:48) times the ratio between the volumes of the unit (cid:96)2
and (cid:96)∞ balls. The volume of the (cid:96)∞ ball is 2d and the volume of B2(1) is

πd/2

Γ(1 + d/2)

.

For simplicity, assume that d is even and therefore

Γ(1 + d/2) = (d/2)! ≥ (cid:16) d/2

(cid:17)d/2

,

e

336

where in the last inequality we used Stirling’s approximation. Overall we obtained
that

|Q| ≤ (2k + 1)d (π/e)d/2 (d/2)−d/2 2−d.

(23.10)
Now lets specify k. For each x ∈ B2(1) let v ∈ Q be the vector whose ith element
is sign(xi)(cid:98)|xi| k(cid:99)/k. Then, for each element we have that |xi − vi| ≤ 1/k and
thus

(cid:107)x − v(cid:107) ≤

√

d
k

.

To ensure that the right-hand side will be at most  we shall set k = (cid:100)√

d/(cid:101).

Plugging this value into Equation (23.10) we conclude that

√

|Q| ≤ (3

d/(2))d (π/e)d/2 (d/2)−d/2 =

(cid:16) 3

(cid:113) π



2e

(cid:17)d ≤(cid:0) 3



(cid:1)d

.

Let x be a vector that can be written as x = U α with U being some orthonor-
mal matrix and (cid:107)α(cid:107)0 ≤ s. Combining the earlier covering property and the JL
lemma (Lemma 23.4) enables us to show that a random W will not distort any
such x.
lemma 23.12 Let U be an orthonormal d × d matrix and let I ⊂ [d] be a set
of indices of size |I| = s. Let S be the span of {Ui : i ∈ I}, where Ui is the ith
column of U . Let δ ∈ (0, 1),  ∈ (0, 1), and n ∈ N such that

n ≥ 24

log(2/δ) + s log(12/)

2

.

Then, with probability of at least 1−δ over a choice of a random matrix W ∈ Rn,d
such that each element of W is independently distributed according to N (0, 1/n),
we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:107)W x(cid:107)

(cid:107)x(cid:107) − 1

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < .

sup
x∈S

It suﬃces to prove the lemma for all x ∈ S with (cid:107)x(cid:107) = 1. We can write
Proof
x = UI α where α ∈ Rs, (cid:107)α(cid:107)2 = 1, and UI is the matrix whose columns are
{Ui : i ∈ I}. Using Lemma 23.11 we know that there exists a set Q of size
|Q| ≤ (12/)s such that

sup

α:(cid:107)α(cid:107)=1

min
v∈Q

(cid:107)α − v(cid:107) ≤ (/4).

But since U is orthogonal we also have that

sup

α:(cid:107)α(cid:107)=1

min
v∈Q

(cid:107)UI α − UI v(cid:107) ≤ (/4).

Applying Lemma 23.4 on the set {UI v : v ∈ Q} we obtain that for n satisfying

23.3 Compressed Sensing

337

the condition given in the lemma, the following holds with probability of at least
1 − δ:

sup
v∈Q

This also implies that

(cid:107)UI v(cid:107)2 − 1

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:107)W UI v(cid:107)2
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:107)W UI v(cid:107)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ /2,
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ /2.

sup
v∈Q

(cid:107)UI v(cid:107) − 1

Let a be the smallest number such that

∀x ∈ S,

(cid:107)W x(cid:107)
(cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ 1 + a.

Clearly a < ∞. Our goal is to show that a ≤ . This follows from the fact that
for any x ∈ S of unit norm there exists v ∈ Q such that (cid:107)x − UI v(cid:107) ≤ /4 and
therefore

(cid:107)W x(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)W UI v(cid:107) + (cid:107)W (x − UI v)(cid:107) ≤ 1 + /2 + (1 + a)/4.

Thus,

∀x ∈ S,

(cid:107)W x(cid:107)
(cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ 1 + (/2 + (1 + a)/4) .

But the deﬁnition of a implies that

a ≤ /2 + (1 + a)/4 ⇒ a ≤ /2 + /4
1 − /4

≤ .

This proves that for all x ∈ S we have
this as well since

(cid:107)W x(cid:107)
(cid:107)x(cid:107) − 1 ≤ . The other side follows from

(cid:107)W x(cid:107) ≥ (cid:107)W UI v(cid:107) − (cid:107)W (x − UI v)(cid:107) ≥ 1 − /2 − (1 + )/4 ≥ 1 − .

The preceding lemma tells us that for x ∈ S of unit norm we have

which implies that

(1 − ) ≤ (cid:107)W x(cid:107) ≤ (1 + ),

(1 − 2 ) ≤ (cid:107)W x(cid:107)2 ≤ (1 + 3 ).

The proof of Theorem 23.9 follows from this by a union bound over all choices
of I.

Dimensionality Reduction

23.4

PCA or Compressed Sensing?

Suppose we would like to apply a dimensionality reduction technique to a given
set of examples. Which method should we use, PCA or compressed sensing? In
this section we tackle this question, by underscoring the underlying assumptions
behind the two methods.

It is helpful ﬁrst to understand when each of the methods can guarantee per-
fect recovery. PCA guarantees perfect recovery whenever the set of examples is
contained in an n dimensional subspace of Rd. Compressed sensing guarantees
perfect recovery whenever the set of examples is sparse (in some basis). On the
basis of these observations, we can describe cases in which PCA will be better
than compressed sensing and vice versa.

As a ﬁrst example, suppose that the examples are the vectors of the standard
basis of Rd, namely, e1, . . . , ed, where each ei is the all zeros vector except 1 in the
ith coordinate. In this case, the examples are 1-sparse. Hence, compressed sensing
will yield a perfect recovery whenever n ≥ Ω(log(d)). On the other hand, PCA
will lead to poor performance, since the data is far from being in an n dimensional
subspace, as long as n < d. Indeed, it is easy ro verify that in such a case, the
averaged recovery error of PCA (i.e., the objective of Equation (23.1) divided by
m) will be (d − n)/d, which is larger than 1/2 whenever n ≤ d/2.

We next show a case where PCA is better than compressed sensing. Consider
m examples that are exactly on an n dimensional subspace. Clearly, in such a
case, PCA will lead to perfect recovery. As to compressed sensing, note that
the examples are n-sparse in any orthonormal basis whose ﬁrst n vectors span
the subspace. Therefore, compressed sensing would also work if we will reduce
the dimension to Ω(n log(d)). However, with exactly n dimensions, compressed
sensing might fail. PCA has also better resilience to certain types of noise. See
(Chang, Weiss & Freeman 2009) for a discussion.

23.5

Summary

We introduced two methods for dimensionality reduction using linear transfor-
mations: PCA and random projections. We have shown that PCA is optimal in
the sense of averaged squared reconstruction error, if we restrict the reconstruc-
tion procedure to be linear as well. However, if we allow nonlinear reconstruction,
PCA is not necessarily the optimal procedure. In particular, for sparse data, ran-
dom projections can signiﬁcantly outperform PCA. This fact is at the heart of
the compressed sensing method.

23.6 Bibliographic Remarks

23.6

Bibliographic Remarks

PCA is equivalent to best subspace approximation using singular value decom-
position (SVD). The SVD method is described in Appendix C. SVD dates back
to Eugenio Beltrami (1873) and Camille Jordan (1874). It has been rediscovered
many times. In the statistical literature, it was introduced by Pearson (1901). Be-
sides PCA and SVD, there are additional names that refer to the same idea and
are being used in diﬀerent scientiﬁc communities. A few examples are the Eckart-
Young theorem (after Carl Eckart and Gale Young who analyzed the method in
1936), the Schmidt-Mirsky theorem, factor analysis, and the Hotelling transform.
Compressed sensing was introduced in Donoho (2006) and in (Candes & Tao

2005). See also Candes (2006).

Exercises

1. In this exercise we show that in the general case, exact recovery of a linear

compression scheme is impossible.
1. let A ∈ Rn,d be an arbitrary compression matrix where n ≤ d − 1. Show

that there exists u, v ∈ Rn, u (cid:54)= v such that Au = Av.

Hint: Take every vector β ∈ [0, 1]d such that (cid:107)β(cid:107)1 ≤ n. Let i be the minimal
index for which βi < 1. If i = n + 1 we are done. Otherwise, show that we can
increase βi, while possibly decreasing βj for some j > i, and obtain a better
solution. This will imply that the optimal solution is to set βi = 1 for i ≤ n
and βi = 0 for i > n.

3. Kernel PCA: In this exercise we show how PCA can be used for construct-
ing nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the basis of the kernel trick (see
Chapter 16).

Let X be some instance space and let S = {x1, . . . , xm} be a set of points
in X . Consider a feature mapping ψ : X → V , where V is some Hilbert space
(possibly of inﬁnite dimension). Let K : X × X be a kernel function, that is,
k(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)ψ(x), ψ(x(cid:48))(cid:105). Kernel PCA is the process of mapping the elements
in S into V using ψ, and then applying PCA over {ψ(x1), . . . , ψ(xm)} into
Rn. The output of this process is the set of reduced elements.

Show how this process can be done in polynomial time in terms of m
and n, assuming that each evaluation of K(·,·) can be calculated in a con-
stant time. In particular, if your implementation requires multiplication of
two matrices A and B, verify that their product can be computed. Similarly,

340

if an eigenvalue decomposition of some matrix C is required, verify that this
decomposition can be computed.

4. An Interpretation of PCA as Variance Maximization:

Let x1, . . . , xm be m vectors in Rd, and let x be a random vector distributed
according to the uniform distribution over x1, . . . , xm. Assume that E[x] = 0.
1. Consider the problem of ﬁnding a unit vector, w ∈ Rd, such that the
random variable (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) has maximal variance. That is, we would like to
solve the problem

Show that the solution of the problem is to set w to be the ﬁrst principle
vector of x1, . . . , xm.
2. Let w1 be the ﬁrst principal component as in the previous question. Now,
suppose we would like to ﬁnd a second unit vector, w2 ∈ Rd, that maxi-
mizes the variance of (cid:104)w2, x(cid:105), but is also uncorrelated to (cid:104)w1, x(cid:105). That is,
we would like to solve:

argmax

w:(cid:107)w(cid:107)=1, E[((cid:104)w1,x(cid:105))((cid:104)w,x(cid:105))]=0

Var[(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)].

Show that the solution to this problem is to set w to be the second principal
component of x1, . . . , xm.
Hint: Note that

E[((cid:104)w1, x(cid:105))((cid:104)w, x(cid:105))] = w(cid:62)

E[xx(cid:62)]w = mw(cid:62)

where A = (cid:80)

i xix(cid:62)

constraint E[((cid:104)w1, x(cid:105))((cid:104)w, x(cid:105))] = 0 is equivalent to the constraint

i . Since w is an eigenvector of A we have that the

(cid:104)w1, w(cid:105) = 0.

5. The Relation between SVD and PCA: Use the SVD theorem (Corol-

lary C.6) for providing an alternative proof of Theorem 23.2.

6. Random Projections Preserve Inner Products: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss

lemma tells us that a random projection preserves distances between a ﬁnite
set of vectors. In this exercise you need to prove that if the set of vectors are
within the unit ball, then not only are the distances between any two vectors
preserved, but the inner product is also preserved.

Let Q be a ﬁnite set of vectors in Rd and assume that for every x ∈ Q we

project these vectors into Rn, for n = c/γ2, then with probability of at least
99% it holds that the projected vectors are linearly separable with margin
γ/2.

24 Generative Models

We started this book with a distribution free learning framework; namely, we
did not impose any assumptions on the underlying distribution over the data.
Furthermore, we followed a discriminative approach in which our goal is not to
learn the underlying distribution but rather to learn an accurate predictor. In
this chapter we describe a generative approach, in which it is assumed that the
underlying distribution over the data has a speciﬁc parametric form and our goal
is to estimate the parameters of the model. This task is called parametric density
estimation.

The discriminative approach has the advantage of directly optimizing the
quantity of interest (the prediction accuracy) instead of learning the underly-
ing distribution. This was phrased as follows by Vladimir Vapnik in his principle
for solving problems using a restricted amount of information:

When solving a given problem, try to avoid a more general problem as an intermediate
step.

Of course, if we succeed in learning the underlying distribution accurately,
we are considered to be “experts” in the sense that we can predict by using
the Bayes optimal classiﬁer. The problem is that it is usually more diﬃcult to
learn the underlying distribution than to learn an accurate predictor. However,
in some situations, it is reasonable to adopt the generative learning approach.
For example, sometimes it is easier (computationally) to estimate the parameters
of the model than to learn a discriminative predictor. Additionally, in some cases
we do not have a speciﬁc task at hand but rather would like to model the data
either for making predictions at a later time without having to retrain a predictor
or for the sake of interpretability of the data.

We start with a popular statistical method for estimating the parameters of
the data, which is called the maximum likelihood principle. Next, we describe two
generative assumptions which greatly simplify the learning process. We also de-
scribe the EM algorithm for calculating the maximum likelihood in the presence
of latent variables. We conclude with a brief description of Bayesian reasoning.

24.1

Maximum Likelihood Estimator

Let us start with a simple example. A drug company developed a new drug to
treat some deadly disease. We would like to estimate the probability of survival
when using the drug. To do so, the drug company sampled a training set of m
people and gave them the drug. Let S = (x1, . . . , xm) denote the training set,
where for each i, xi = 1 if the ith person survived and xi = 0 otherwise. We can
model the underlying distribution using a single parameter, θ ∈ [0, 1], indicating
the probability of survival.

We now would like to estimate the parameter θ on the basis of the training
set S. A natural idea is to use the average number of 1’s in S as an estimator.
That is,

m(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:114)

ˆθ =

1
m

xi.

(24.1)

Clearly, ES[ˆθ] = θ. That is, ˆθ is an unbiased estimator of θ. Furthermore, since ˆθ is
the average of m i.i.d. binary random variables we can use Hoeﬀding’s inequality
to get that with probability of at least 1 − δ over the choice of S we have that

|ˆθ − θ| ≤

log(2/δ)

2 m

.

(24.2)

Another interpretation of ˆθ is as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, as we
formally explain now. We ﬁrst write the probability of generating the sample S:

P[S = (x1, . . . , xm)] =

θxi (1 − θ)1−xi = θ

(cid:80)

(cid:80)
i xi (1 − θ)
i(1−xi).

m(cid:89)

(cid:88)

We deﬁne the log likelihood of S, given the parameter θ, as the log of the preceding
expression:

L(S; θ) = log (P[S = (x1, . . . , xm)]) = log(θ)

xi + log(1 − θ)

The maximum likelihood estimator is the parameter that maximizes the likeli-

Next, we show that in our case, Equation (24.1) is a maximum likelihood esti-

it to zero:

(cid:80)

Solving the equation for θ we obtain the estimator given in Equation (24.1).

24.1.1

Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Continuous Random Variables
Let X be a continuous random variable. Then, for most x ∈ R we have P[X =
x] = 0 and therefore the deﬁnition of likelihood as given before is trivialized. To
overcome this technical problem we deﬁne the likelihood as log of the density of
the probability of X at x. That is, given an i.i.d. training set S = (x1, . . . , xm)
sampled according to a density distribution Pθ we deﬁne the likelihood of S given
θ as

(cid:32) m(cid:89)

m(cid:88)

L(S; θ) = log

Pθ(xi)

=

log(Pθ(xi)).

As before, the maximum likelihood estimator is a maximizer of L(S; θ) with
respect to θ.

As an example, consider a Gaussian random variable, for which the density

function of X is parameterized by θ = (µ, σ) and is deﬁned as follows:

To ﬁnd a parameter θ = (µ, σ) that optimizes this we take the derivative of the

Solving the preceding equations we obtain the maximum likelihood estimates:

Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not always an unbiased estimator.
For example, while ˆµ is unbiased, it is possible to show that the estimate ˆσ of
the variance is biased (Exercise 1).

Simplifying Notation
To simplify our notation, we use P[X = x] in this chapter to describe both the
probability that X = x (for discrete random variables) and the density of the
distribution at x (for continuous variables).

Risk Minimization (ERM) principle, which we studied extensively in previous
chapters. Recall that in the ERM principle we have a hypothesis class H and
we use the training set for choosing a hypothesis h ∈ H that minimizes the
empirical risk. We now show that the maximum likelihood estimator is an ERM
for a particular loss function.

Given a parameter θ and an observation x, we deﬁne the loss of θ on x as

(cid:96)(θ, x) = − log(Pθ[x]).

(24.4)

That is, (cid:96)(θ, x) is the negation of the log-likelihood of the observation x, assuming
the data is distributed according to Pθ. This loss function is often referred to as
the log-loss. On the basis of this deﬁnition it is immediate that the maximum
likelihood principle is equivalent to minimizing the empirical risk with respect
to the loss function given in Equation (24.4). That is,

argmin

(− log(Pθ[xi])) = argmax

log(Pθ[xi]).

Assuming that the data is distributed according to a distribution P (not neces-
sarily of the parametric form we employ), the true risk of a parameter θ becomes

DRE[P||Pθ]

where DRE is called the relative entropy, and H is called the entropy func-
tion. The relative entropy is a divergence measure between two probabilities.
For discrete variables, it is always nonnegative and is equal to 0 only if the two
distributions are the same. It follows that the true risk is minimal when Pθ = P.
The expression given in Equation (24.5) underscores how our generative as-
sumption aﬀects our density estimation, even in the limit of inﬁnite data. It
shows that if the underlying distribution is indeed of a parametric form, then by
choosing the correct parameter we can make the risk be the entropy of the distri-
bution. However, if the distribution is not of the assumed parametric form, even
the best parameter leads to an inferior model and the suboptimality is measured
by the relative entropy divergence.

24.1.3

Generalization Analysis

How good is the maximum likelihood estimator when we learn from a ﬁnite
training set?

346

Generative Models

To answer this question we need to deﬁne how we assess the quality of an approxi-
mated solution of the density estimation problem. Unlike discriminative learning,
where there is a clear notion of “loss,” in generative learning there are various
ways to deﬁne the loss of a model. On the basis of the previous subsection, one
natural candidate is the expected log-loss as given in Equation (24.5).

In some situations, it is easy to prove that the maximum likelihood principle
guarantees low true risk as well. For example, consider the problem of estimating
the mean of a Gaussian variable of unit variance. We saw previously that the
maximum likelihood estimator is the average: ˆµ = 1
i xi. Let µ(cid:63) be the optimal
m
parameter. Then,

Next, we note that ˆµ is the average of m Gaussian variables and therefore it is
also distributed normally with mean µ(cid:63) and variance σ(cid:63)/m. From this fact we
can derive bounds of the form: with probability of at least 1 − δ we have that
|ˆµ − µ(cid:63)| ≤  where  depends on σ(cid:63)/m and on δ.

In some situations, the maximum likelihood estimator clearly overﬁts. For
example, consider a Bernoulli random variable X and let P[X = 1] = θ(cid:63). As
we saw previously, using Hoeﬀding’s inequality we can easily derive a guarantee
on |θ(cid:63) − ˆθ| that holds with high probability (see Equation (24.2)). However, if
our goal is to obtain a small value of the expected log-loss function as deﬁned in
Equation (24.5) we might fail. For example, assume that θ(cid:63) is nonzero but very
small. Then, the probability that no element of a sample of size m will be 1 is
(1 − θ(cid:63))m, which is greater than e−2θ(cid:63) m. It follows that whenever m ≤ log(2)
2θ(cid:63) ,
the probability that the sample is all zeros is at least 50%, and in that case, the
maximum likelihood rule will set ˆθ = 0. But the true risk of the estimate ˆθ = 0
is

E
x∼θ(cid:63)

[(cid:96)(ˆθ, x)] = θ(cid:63)(cid:96)(ˆθ, 1) + (1 − θ(cid:63))(cid:96)(ˆθ, 0)

= θ(cid:63) log(1/ˆθ) + (1 − θ(cid:63)) log(1/(1 − ˆθ))
= θ(cid:63) log(1/0) = ∞.

This simple example shows that we should be careful in applying the maximum
likelihood principle.

To overcome overﬁtting, we can use the variety of tools we encountered pre-

24.2 Naive Bayes

viously in the book. A simple regularization technique is outlined in Exercise
2.

24.2

Naive Bayes

The Naive Bayes classiﬁer is a classical demonstration of how generative as-
sumptions and parameter estimations simplify the learning process. Consider
the problem of predicting a label y ∈ {0, 1} on the basis of a vector of features
x = (x1, . . . , xd), where we assume that each xi is in {0, 1}. Recall that the Bayes
optimal classiﬁer is

hBayes(x) = argmax
y∈{0,1}

P[Y = y|X = x].

To describe the probability function P[Y = y|X = x] we need 2d parameters,
each of which corresponds to P[Y = 1|X = x] for a certain value of x ∈ {0, 1}d.
This implies that the number of examples we need grows exponentially with the
number of features.

In the Naive Bayes approach we make the (rather naive) generative assumption

that given the label, the features are independent of each other. That is,

d(cid:89)

P[X = x|Y = y] =

P[Xi = xi|Y = y].

With this assumption and using Bayes’ rule, the Bayes optimal classiﬁer can be
further simpliﬁed:

i=1

hBayes(x) = argmax
y∈{0,1}

= argmax
y∈{0,1}

P[Y = y|X = x]
P[Y = y]P[X = x|Y = y]

= argmax
y∈{0,1}

P[Y = y]

P[Xi = xi|Y = y].

(24.7)

d(cid:89)

i=1

That is, now the number of parameters we need to estimate is only 2d + 1.
Here, the generative assumption we made reduced signiﬁcantly the number of
parameters we need to learn.

When we also estimate the parameters using the maximum likelihood princi-

ple, the resulting classiﬁer is called the Naive Bayes classiﬁer.

24.3

Linear Discriminant Analysis

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is another demonstration of how generative
assumptions simplify the learning process. As in the Naive Bayes classiﬁer we
consider again the problem of predicting a label y ∈ {0, 1} on the basis of a

348

Generative Models

vector of features x = (x1, . . . , xd). But now the generative assumption is as
follows. First, we assume that P[Y = 1] = P[Y = 0] = 1/2. Second, we assume
that the conditional probability of X given Y is a Gaussian distribution. Finally,
the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution is the same for both values
of the label. Formally, let µ0, µ1 ∈ Rd and let Σ be a covariance matrix. Then,
the density distribution is given by

P[X = x|Y = y] =

(2π)d/2|Σ|1/2

exp

(x − µy)T Σ−1(x − µy)

.

(cid:18)

As we have shown in the previous section, using Bayes’ rule we can write

hBayes(x) = argmax
y∈{0,1}

P[Y = y]P[X = x|Y = y].

This means that we will predict hBayes(x) = 1 iﬀ

(cid:18)P[Y = 1]P[X = x|Y = 1]

P[Y = 0]P[X = x|Y = 0]

> 0.

log

This ratio is often called the log-likelihood ratio.

In our case, the log-likelihood ratio becomes

1

2 (x − µ0)T Σ−1(x − µ0) − 1

2 (x − µ1)T Σ−1(x − µ1)

We can rewrite this as (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) + b where

w = (µ1 − µ0)T Σ−1

and b = 1
2

(cid:0)µT

0 Σ−1µ0 − µT

1 Σ−1µ1

(24.8)

(cid:1) .

As a result of the preceding derivation we obtain that under the aforemen-
tioned generative assumptions, the Bayes optimal classiﬁer is a linear classiﬁer.
Additionally, one may train the classiﬁer by estimating the parameter µ0, µ1
and Σ from the data, using, for example, the maximum likelihood estimator.
With those estimators at hand, the values of w and b can be calculated as in
Equation (24.8).

24.4

Latent Variables and the EM Algorithm

In generative models we assume that the data is generated by sampling from
a speciﬁc parametric distribution over our instance space X . Sometimes, it is
convenient to express this distribution using latent random variables. A natural
example is a mixture of k Gaussian distributions. That is, X = Rd and we
assume that each x is generated as follows. First, we choose a random number in
{1, . . . , k}. Let Y be a random variable corresponding to this choice, and denote
P[Y = y] = cy. Second, we choose x on the basis of the value of Y according to
a Gaussian distribution

Therefore, the density of X can be written as:

.

Note that Y is a hidden variable that we do not observe in our data. Neverthe-
less, we introduce Y since it helps us describe a simple parametric form of the
probability of X.

More generally, let θ be the parameters of the joint distribution of X and Y
(e.g., in the preceding example, θ consists of cy, µy, and Σy, for all y = 1, . . . , k).
Then, the log-likelihood of an observation x can be written as

log (Pθ[X = x]) = log

Pθ[X = x, Y = y]

.

(cid:32) k(cid:88)

Given an i.i.d. sample, S = (x1, . . . , xm), we would like to ﬁnd θ that maxi-

In many situations, the summation inside the log makes the preceding opti-
mization problem computationally hard. The Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm, due to Dempster, Laird, and Rubin, is an iterative procedure for
searching a (local) maximum of L(θ). While EM is not guaranteed to ﬁnd the
global maximum, it often works reasonably well in practice.

EM is designed for those cases in which, had we known the values of the latent
variables Y , then the maximum likelihood optimization problem would have been
tractable. More precisely, deﬁne the following function over m × k matrices and
the set of parameters θ:

F (Q, θ) =

Qi,y log (Pθ[X = xi, Y = y]) .

Generative Models

If each row of Q deﬁnes a probability over the ith latent variable given X = xi,
then we can interpret F (Q, θ) as the expected log-likelihood of a training set
(x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym), where the expectation is with respect to the choice of
each yi on the basis of the ith row of Q. In the deﬁnition of F , the summation is
outside the log, and we assume that this makes the optimization problem with
respect to θ tractable:
assumption 24.1 For any matrix Q ∈ [0, 1]m,k, such that each row of Q sums
to 1, the optimization problem

is tractable.

argmax

F (Q, θ)

θ

The intuitive idea of EM is that we have a “chicken and egg” problem. On one
hand, had we known Q, then by our assumption, the optimization problem of
ﬁnding the best θ is tractable. On the other hand, had we known the parameters
θ we could have set Qi,y to be the probability of Y = y given that X = xi.
The EM algorithm therefore alternates between ﬁnding θ given Q and ﬁnding Q
given θ. Formally, EM ﬁnds a sequence of solutions (Q(1), θ(1)), (Q(2), θ(2)), . . .
where at iteration t, we construct (Q(t+1), θ(t+1)) by performing two steps.
• Expectation Step: Set

i,y = Pθ(t)[Y = y|X = xi].
Q(t+1)

(24.10)

This step is called the Expectation step, because it yields a new probabil-
ity over the latent variables, which deﬁnes a new expected log-likelihood
function over θ.

• Maximization Step: Set θ(t+1) to be the maximizer of the expected log-

likelihood, where the expectation is according to Q(t+1):

θ(t+1) = argmax

F (Q(t+1), θ).

(24.11)

θ

By our assumption, it is possible to solve this optimization problem eﬃ-
ciently.

The initial values of θ(1) and Q(1) are usually chosen at random and the
procedure terminates after the improvement in the likelihood value stops being
signiﬁcant.

24.4.1

EM as an Alternate Maximization Algorithm

To analyze the EM algorithm, we ﬁrst view it as an alternate maximization
algorithm. Deﬁne the following objective function

be the set of matrices whose rows deﬁne probabilities over [k]. The following
lemma shows that EM performs alternate maximization iterations for maximiz-
ing G.

Furthermore, G(Q(t+1), θ(t)) = L(θ(t)).

and shows that G(Q(t+1), θ(t)) = L(θ(t)).

The preceding lemma immediately implies:

theorem 24.3 The EM procedure never decreases the log-likelihood; namely,
for all t,

L(θ(t+1)) ≥ L(θ(t)).

Proof By the lemma we have

L(θ(t+1)) = G(Q(t+2), θ(t+1)) ≥ G(Q(t+1), θ(t)) = L(θ(t)).

24.4.2

EM for Mixture of Gaussians (Soft k-Means)
Consider the case of a mixture of k Gaussians in which θ is a triplet (c,{µ1, . . . , µk},{Σ1, . . . , Σk})
where Pθ[Y = y] = cy and Pθ[X = x|Y = y] is as given in Equation (24.9). For
simplicity, we assume that Σ1 = Σ2 = ··· = Σk = I, where I is the identity
matrix. Specifying the EM algorithm for this case we obtain the following:
• Expectation step: For each i ∈ [m] and y ∈ [k] we have that

Pθ(t) [Y = y|X = xi] =

It is interesting to compare the preceding algorithm to the k-means algorithm
described in Chapter 22. In the k-means algorithm, we ﬁrst assign each example
to a cluster according to the distance (cid:107)xi − µy(cid:107). Then, we update each center
µy according to the average of the examples assigned to this cluster. In the EM
approach, however, we determine the probability that each example belongs to
each cluster. Then, we update the centers on the basis of a weighted sum over
the entire sample. For this reason, the EM approach for k-means is sometimes
called “soft k-means.”

24.5

Bayesian Reasoning

The maximum likelihood estimator follows a frequentist approach. This means
that we refer to the parameter θ as a ﬁxed parameter and the only problem is
that we do not know its value. A diﬀerent approach to parameter estimation
is called Bayesian reasoning. In the Bayesian approach, our uncertainty about
θ is also modeled using probability theory. That is, we think of θ as a random
variable as well and refer to the distribution P[θ] as a prior distribution. As its
name indicates, the prior distribution should be deﬁned by the learner prior to
observing the data.

As an example, let us consider again the drug company which developed a
new drug. On the basis of past experience, the statisticians at the drug company
believe that whenever a drug has reached the level of clinic experiments on
people, it is likely to be eﬀective. They model this prior belief by deﬁning a
density distribution on θ such that

(cid:40)

P[θ] =

0.8

0.2

if θ > 0.5
if θ ≤ 0.5

(24.15)

354

Generative Models

As before, given a speciﬁc value of θ, it is assumed that the conditional proba-
bility, P[X = x|θ], is known. In the drug company example, X takes values in
{0, 1} and P[X = x|θ] = θx(1 − θ)1−x.

Once the prior distribution over θ and the conditional distribution over X
given θ are deﬁned, we again have complete knowledge of the distribution over
X. This is because we can write the probability over X as a marginal probability

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

P[X = x] =

P[X = x, θ] =

P[θ]P[X = x|θ],

θ

θ

where the last equality follows from the deﬁnition of conditional probability. If
θ is continuous we replace P[θ] with the density function and the sum becomes
an integral:

(cid:90)

P[X = x] =

P[θ]P[X = x|θ] dθ.

θ

Seemingly, once we know P[X = x], a training set S = (x1, . . . , xm) tells us
nothing as we are already experts who know the distribution over a new point
X. However, the Bayesian view introduces dependency between S and X. This is
because we now refer to θ as a random variable. A new point X and the previous
points in S are independent only conditioned on θ. This is diﬀerent from the
frequentist philosophy in which θ is a parameter that we might not know, but
since it is just a parameter of the distribution, a new point X and previous points
S are always independent.

In the Bayesian framework, since X and S are not independent anymore, what
we would like to calculate is the probability of X given S, which by the chain
rule can be written as follows:

P[X = x|S] =

P[X = x|θ, S]P[θ|S] =

P[X = x|θ]P[θ|S].

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

θ

θ

The second inequality follows from the assumption that X and S are independent
when we condition on θ. Using Bayes’ rule we have
P[S|θ]P[θ]

P[θ|S] =

P[S]

,

and together with the assumption that points are independent conditioned on θ,
we can write

P[θ|S] =

P[S|θ]P[θ]

P[S]

=

P[S]

P[X = xi|θ]P[θ].

We therefore obtain the following expression for Bayesian prediction:

P[X = x|S] =

P[X = x|θ]

P[X = xi|θ]P[θ].

similar to the maximum likelihood prediction, except it adds “pseudoexamples”
to the training set, thus biasing the prediction toward the uniform prior.

Maximum A Posteriori
In many situations, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a closed form solution to the integral
given in Equation (24.16). Several numerical methods can be used to approxi-
mate this integral. Another popular solution is to ﬁnd a single θ which maximizes
P[θ|S]. The value of θ which maximizes P[θ|S] is called the Maximum A Poste-
riori estimator. Once this value is found, we can calculate the probability that
X = x given the maximum a posteriori estimator and independently on S.

Summary

In the generative approach to machine learning we aim at modeling the distri-
bution over the data. In particular, in parametric density estimation we further
assume that the underlying distribution over the data has a speciﬁc paramet-
ric form and our goal is to estimate the parameters of the model. We have
described several principles for parameter estimation, including maximum like-
lihood, Bayesian estimation, and maximum a posteriori. We have also described
several speciﬁc algorithms for implementing the maximum likelihood under dif-
ferent assumptions on the underlying data distribution, in particular, Naive
Bayes, LDA, and EM.

24.7

Bibliographic Remarks

The maximum likelihood principle was studied by Ronald Fisher in the beginning
of the 20th century. Bayesian statistics follow Bayes’ rule, which is named after
the 18th century English mathematician Thomas Bayes.

There are many excellent books on the generative and Bayesian approaches
to machine learning. See, for example, (Bishop 2006, Koller & Friedman 2009,
MacKay 2003, Murphy 2012, Barber 2012).

25 Feature Selection and Generation

In the beginning of the book, we discussed the abstract model of learning, in
which the prior knowledge utilized by the learner is fully encoded by the choice
of the hypothesis class. However, there is another modeling choice, which we
have so far ignored: How do we represent the instance space X ? For example, in
the papayas learning problem, we proposed the hypothesis class of rectangles in
the softness-color two dimensional plane. That is, our ﬁrst modeling choice was
to represent a papaya as a two dimensional point corresponding to its softness
and color. Only after that did we choose the hypothesis class of rectangles as a
class of mappings from the plane into the label set. The transformation from the
real world object “papaya” into the scalar representing its softness or its color
is called a feature function or a feature for short; namely, any measurement of
the real world object can be regarded as a feature. If X is a subset of a vector
space, each x ∈ X is sometimes referred to as a feature vector. It is important to
understand that the way we encode real world objects as an instance space X is
by itself prior knowledge about the problem.

Furthermore, even when we already have an instance space X which is rep-
resented as a subset of a vector space, we might still want to change it into a
diﬀerent representation and apply a hypothesis class on top of it. That is, we
may deﬁne a hypothesis class on X by composing some class H on top of a
feature function which maps X into some other vector space X (cid:48). We have al-
ready encountered examples of such compositions – in Chapter 15 we saw that
kernel-based SVM learns a composition of the class of halfspaces over a feature
mapping ψ that maps each original instance in X into some Hilbert space. And,
indeed, the choice of ψ is another form of prior knowledge we impose on the
problem.

In this chapter we study several methods for constructing a good feature set.
We start with the problem of feature selection, in which we have a large pool
of features and our goal is to select a small number of features that will be
used by our predictor. Next, we discuss feature manipulations and normalization.
These include simple transformations that we apply on our original features. Such
transformations may decrease the sample complexity of our learning algorithm,
its bias, or its computational complexity. Last, we discuss several approaches for
feature learning. In these methods, we try to automate the process of feature
construction.

Feature Selection and Generation

We emphasize that while there are some common techniques for feature learn-
ing one may want to try, the No-Free-Lunch theorem implies that there is no ulti-
mate feature learner. Any feature learning algorithm might fail on some problem.
In other words, the success of each feature learner relies (sometimes implicitly)
on some form of prior assumption on the data distribution. Furthermore, the
relative quality of features highly depends on the learning algorithm we are later
going to apply using these features. This is illustrated in the following example.
Example 25.1 Consider a regression problem in which X = R2, Y = R, and
the loss function is the squared loss. Suppose that the underlying distribution
is such that an example (x, y) is generated as follows: First, we sample x1 from
the uniform distribution over [−1, 1]. Then, we deterministically set y = x1
2.
Finally, the second feature is set to be x2 = y + z, where z is sampled from the
uniform distribution over [−0.01, 0.01]. Suppose we would like to choose a single
feature. Intuitively, the ﬁrst feature should be preferred over the second feature
as the target can be perfectly predicted based on the ﬁrst feature alone, while it
cannot be perfectly predicted based on the second feature. Indeed, choosing the
ﬁrst feature would be the right choice if we are later going to apply polynomial
regression of degree at least 2. However, if the learner is going to be a linear
regressor, then we should prefer the second feature over the ﬁrst one, since the
optimal linear predictor based on the ﬁrst feature will have a larger risk than
the optimal linear predictor based on the second feature.

Feature Selection
Throughout this section we assume that X = Rd. That is, each instance is repre-
sented as a vector of d features. Our goal is to learn a predictor that only relies
on k (cid:28) d features. Predictors that use only a small subset of features require a
smaller memory footprint and can be applied faster. Furthermore, in applications
such as medical diagnostics, obtaining each possible “feature” (e.g., test result)
can be costly; therefore, a predictor that uses only a small number of features
is desirable even at the cost of a small degradation in performance, relative to
a predictor that uses more features. Finally, constraining the hypothesis class to
use a small subset of features can reduce its estimation error and thus prevent
overﬁtting.

Ideally, we could have tried all subsets of k out of d features and choose the
subset which leads to the best performing predictor. However, such an exhaustive
search is usually computationally intractable. In the following we describe three
computationally feasible approaches for feature selection. While these methods
cannot guarantee ﬁnding the optimal subset, they often work reasonably well in
practice. Some of the methods come with formal guarantees on the quality of the
selected subsets under certain assumptions. We do not discuss these guarantees
here.

25.1

25.1 Feature Selection

25.1.1

Filters

Maybe the simplest approach for feature selection is the ﬁlter method, in which
we assess individual features, independently of other features, according to some
quality measure. We can then select the k features that achieve the highest score
(alternatively, decide also on the number of features to select according to the
value of their scores).

Many quality measures for features have been proposed in the literature.
Maybe the most straightforward approach is to set the score of a feature ac-
cording to the error rate of a predictor that is trained solely by that feature.
To illustrate this, consider a linear regression problem with the squared loss.
Let v = (x1,j, . . . , xm,j) ∈ Rm be a vector designating the values of the jth
feature on a training set of m examples and let y = (y1, . . . , ym) ∈ Rm be the
values of the target on the same m examples. The empirical squared loss of an
ERM linear predictor that uses only the jth feature would be

min
a,b∈R

1
m

(cid:107)av + b − y(cid:107)2,

(cid:80)m

where the meaning of adding a scalar b to a vector v is adding b to all coordinates
of v. To solve this problem, let ¯v = 1
i=1 vi be the averaged value of the
m
feature and let ¯y = 1
i=1 yi be the averaged value of the target. Clearly (see
m
Exercise 1),

(cid:80)m

min
a,b∈R

1
m

(cid:107)av + b − y(cid:107)2 = min
a,b∈R

1
m

(cid:107)a(v − ¯v) + b − (y − ¯y)(cid:107)2.

(25.1)

Taking the derivative of the right-hand side objective with respect to b and
comparing it to zero we obtain that b = 0. Similarly, solving for a (once we know
that b = 0) yields a = (cid:104)v − ¯v, y − ¯y(cid:105)/(cid:107)v − ¯v(cid:107)2. Plugging this value back into the
objective we obtain the value

(cid:107)y − ¯y(cid:107)2 − ((cid:104)v − ¯v, y − ¯y(cid:105))2

(cid:107)v − ¯v(cid:107)2

.

Ranking the features according to the minimal loss they achieve is equivalent
to ranking them according to the absolute value of the following score (where
now a higher score yields a better feature):

(cid:104)v − ¯v, y − ¯y(cid:105)
(cid:107)v − ¯v(cid:107)(cid:107)y − ¯y(cid:107) =

1

(cid:113) 1
m(cid:107)v − ¯v(cid:107)2

(cid:113) 1
m (cid:104)v − ¯v, y − ¯y(cid:105)
m(cid:107)y − ¯y(cid:107)2

.

(25.2)

The preceding expression is known as Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient. The nu-
merator is the empirical estimate of the covariance of the jth feature and the
target value, E[(v − E v)(y − E y)], while the denominator is the squared root of
the empirical estimate for the variance of the jth feature, E[(v − E v)2], times
the variance of the target. Pearson’s coeﬃcient ranges from −1 to 1, where if
the Pearson’s coeﬃcient is either 1 or −1, there is a linear mapping from v to y
with zero empirical risk.

360

Feature Selection and Generation

If Pearson’s coeﬃcient equals zero it means that the optimal linear function
from v to y is the all-zeros function, which means that v alone is useless for
predicting y. However, this does not mean that v is a bad feature, as it might
be the case that together with other features v can perfectly predict y. Indeed,
consider a simple example in which the target is generated by the function y =
x1 + 2x2. Assume also that x1 is generated from the uniform distribution over
{±1}, and x2 = − 1
2 z, where z is also generated i.i.d. from the uniform
distribution over {±1}. Then, E[x1] = E[x2] = E[y] = 0, and we also have

2 x1 + 1

E[yx1] = E[x2

1] + 2 E[x2x1] = E[x2

1] − E[x2

1] + E[zx1] = 0.

Therefore, for a large enough training set, the ﬁrst feature is likely to have a
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient that is close to zero, and hence it will most
probably not be selected. However, no function can predict the target value well
without knowing the ﬁrst feature.

There are many other score functions that can be used by a ﬁlter method.
Notable examples are estimators of the mutual information or the area under
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. All of these score functions
suﬀer from similar problems to the one illustrated previously. We refer the reader
to Guyon & Elisseeﬀ (2003).

25.1.2

Greedy Selection Approaches

Greedy selection is another popular approach for feature selection. Unlike ﬁlter
methods, greedy selection approaches are coupled with the underlying learning
algorithm. The simplest instance of greedy selection is forward greedy selection.
We start with an empty set of features, and then we gradually add one feature
at a time to the set of selected features. Given that our current set of selected
features is I, we go over all i /∈ I, and apply the learning algorithm on the set
of features I ∪ {i}. Each such application yields a diﬀerent predictor, and we
choose to add the feature that yields the predictor with the smallest risk (on
the training set or on a validation set). This process continues until we either
select k features, where k is a predeﬁned budget of allowed features, or achieve
an accurate enough predictor.

Example 25.2 (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) To illustrate the forward
greedy selection approach, we specify it to the problem of linear regression with
the squared loss. Let X ∈ Rm,d be a matrix whose rows are the m training
instances. Let y ∈ Rm be the vector of the m labels. For every i ∈ [d], let Xi
be the ith column of X. Given a set I ⊂ [d] we denote by XI the matrix whose
columns are {Xi : i ∈ I}.
The forward greedy selection method starts with I0 = ∅. At iteration t, we

look for the feature index jt, which is in

argmin

min
w∈Rt

(cid:107)XIt−1∪{j}w − y(cid:107)2.

25.1 Feature Selection

361

Then, we update It = It−1 ∪ {jt}.

We now describe a more eﬃcient implementation of the forward greedy selec-
tion approach for linear regression which is called Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
(OMP). The idea is to keep an orthogonal basis of the features aggregated so
far. Let Vt be a matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis of the columns
of XIt.

Clearly,

(cid:107)XItw − y(cid:107)2 = min
θ∈Rt

min

w

(cid:107)Vtθ − y(cid:107)2.

We will maintain a vector θt which minimizes the right-hand side of the equation.
Initially, we set I0 = ∅, V0 = ∅, and θ1 to be the empty vector. At round t, for
every j, we decompose Xj = vj + uj where vj = Vt−1V (cid:62)
t−1Xj is the projection
of Xj onto the subspace spanned by Vt−1 and uj is the part of Xj orthogonal to
Vt−1 (see Appendix C). Then,

The OMP procedure maintains an orthonormal basis of the selected features,
where in the preceding description, the orthonormalization property is obtained
by a procedure similar to Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization. In practice, the
Gram-Schmidt procedure is often numerically unstable. In the pseudocode that
follows we use SVD (see Section C.4) at the end of each round to obtain an
orthonormal basis in a numerically stable manner.

More Eﬃcient Greedy Selection Criteria
Let R(w) be the empirical risk of a vector w. At each round of the forward
greedy selection method, and for every possible j, we should minimize R(w)
over the vectors w whose support is It−1 ∪ {j}. This might be time consuming.

A simpler approach is to choose jt that minimizes

argmin

j

η∈R R(wt−1 + ηej),
min

where ej is the all zeros vector except 1 in the jth element. That is, we keep
the weights of the previously chosen coordinates intact and only optimize over
the new variable. Therefore, for each j we need to solve an optimization problem
over a single variable, which is a much easier task than optimizing over t.

An even simpler approach is to upper bound R(w) using a “simple” function
and then choose the feature which leads to the largest decrease in this upper
bound. For example, if R is a β-smooth function (see Equation (12.5) in Chap-
ter 12), then

R(w + ηej) ≤ R(w) + η

∂R(w)

∂wj

+ βη2/2.

Minimizing the right-hand side over η yields η = − ∂R(w)
value into the above yields

(cid:18) ∂R(w)

(cid:19)2

· 1
β and plugging this

.

R(w + ηej) ≤ R(w) − 1
2β

∂wj

This value is minimized if the partial derivative of R(w) with respect to wj is
maximal. We can therefore choose jt to be the index of the largest coordinate of
the gradient of R(w) at w.

Backward Elimination
Another popular greedy selection approach is backward elimination. Here, we
start with the full set of features, and then we gradually remove one feature at a
time from the set of features. Given that our current set of selected features is I,
we go over all i ∈ I, and apply the learning algorithm on the set of features I\{i}.
Each such application yields a diﬀerent predictor, and we choose to remove the
feature i for which the predictor obtained from I \ {i} has the smallest risk (on
the training set or on a validation set).

Naturally, there are many possible variants of the backward elimination idea.

It is also possible to combine forward and backward greedy steps.

25.1.3

Sparsity-Inducing Norms

The problem of minimizing the empirical risk subject to a budget of k features
can be written as

min

w

LS(w)

s.t.

(cid:107)w(cid:107)0 ≤ k,

where1

(cid:107)w(cid:107)0 = |{i : wi (cid:54)= 0}|.

In other words, we want w to be sparse, which implies that we only need to
measure the features corresponding to nonzero elements of w.

convex function (cid:107)w(cid:107)0 with the (cid:96)1 norm, (cid:107)w(cid:107)1 = (cid:80)d

Solving this optimization problem is computationally hard (Natarajan 1995,
Davis, Mallat & Avellaneda 1997). A possible relaxation is to replace the non-
i=1 |wi|, and to solve the

problem

min

w

LS(w)

s.t. (cid:107)w(cid:107)1 ≤ k1,

(25.4)

where k1 is a parameter. Since the (cid:96)1 norm is a convex function, this problem
can be solved eﬃciently as long as the loss function is convex. A related problem
is minimizing the sum of LS(w) plus an (cid:96)1 norm regularization term,

(LS(w) + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)1) ,

min

w

(25.5)

where λ is a regularization parameter. Since for any k1 there exists a λ such that
1 The function (cid:107) · (cid:107)0 is often referred to as the (cid:96)0 norm. Despite the use of the “norm”

notation, (cid:107) · (cid:107)0 is not really a norm; for example, it does not satisfy the positive
homogeneity property of norms, (cid:107)aw(cid:107)0 (cid:54)= |a| (cid:107)w(cid:107)0.

364

Feature Selection and Generation

Equation (25.4) and Equation (25.5) lead to the same solution, the two problems
are in some sense equivalent.

The (cid:96)1 regularization often induces sparse solutions. To illustrate this, let us

start with the simple optimization problem

(cid:18) 1

2

min
w∈R

(cid:19)

w2 − xw + λ|w|

.

(25.6)

It is easy to verify (see Exercise 2) that the solution to this problem is the “soft
thresholding” operator

w = sign(x) [|x| − λ]+ ,

(25.7)
def= max{a, 0}. That is, as long as the absolute value of x is smaller

where [a]+
than λ, the optimal solution will be zero.

Next, consider a one dimensional regression problem with respect to the squared

loss:

argmin
w∈Rm

We can rewrite the problem as

(cid:32)

(cid:32)

then the optimal solution is

(cid:33)

(cid:33)

w = sign((cid:104)x, y(cid:105)) [|(cid:104)x, y(cid:105)|/m − λ]+ .

That is, the solution will be zero unless the correlation between the feature x
and the labels vector y is larger than λ.

Remark 25.4 Unlike the (cid:96)1 norm, the (cid:96)2 norm does not induce sparse solutions.
Indeed, consider the problem above with an (cid:96)2 regularization, namely,

(cid:32)

m(cid:88)

i=1

1
2m

(xiw − yi)2 + λw2

.

argmin
w∈Rm

Then, the optimal solution is

w =

(cid:104)x, y(cid:105)/m

(cid:107)x(cid:107)2/m + 2λ

.

This solution will be nonzero even if the correlation between x and y is very small.
In contrast, as we have shown before, when using (cid:96)1 regularization, w will be
nonzero only if the correlation between x and y is larger than the regularization
parameter λ.

25.2 Feature Manipulation and Normalization

365

Adding (cid:96)1 regularization to a linear regression problem with the squared loss

yields the LASSO algorithm, deﬁned as

(cid:19)

(cid:107)Xw − y(cid:107)2 + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)1

.

(25.8)

(cid:18) 1

argmin

w

2m

Under some assumptions on the distribution and the regularization parameter
λ, the LASSO will ﬁnd sparse solutions (see, for example, (Zhao & Yu 2006)
and the references therein). Another advantage of the (cid:96)1 norm is that a vector
with low (cid:96)1 norm can be “sparsiﬁed” (see, for example, (Shalev-Shwartz, Zhang
& Srebro 2010) and the references therein).

25.2

Feature Manipulation and Normalization

Feature manipulations or normalization include simple transformations that we
apply on each of our original features. Such transformations may decrease the
approximation or estimation errors of our hypothesis class or can yield a faster
algorithm. Similarly to the problem of feature selection, here again there are no
absolute “good” and “bad” transformations, but rather each transformation that
we apply should be related to the learning algorithm we are going to apply on
the resulting feature vector as well as to our prior assumptions on the problem.
To motivate normalization, consider a linear regression problem with the
squared loss. Let X ∈ Rm,d be a matrix whose rows are the instance vectors
and let y ∈ Rm be a vector of target values. Recall that ridge regression returns
the vector

(cid:107)Xw − y(cid:107)2 + λ(cid:107)w(cid:107)2

= (2λmI + X(cid:62)X)−1X(cid:62)y.

Suppose that d = 2 and the underlying data distribution is as follows. First we
sample y uniformly at random from {±1}. Then, we set x1 to be y + 0.5α, where
α is sampled uniformly at random from {±1}, and we set x2 to be 0.0001y. Note
that the optimal weight vector is w(cid:63) = [0; 10000], and LD(w(cid:63)) = 0. However,
the objective of ridge regression at w(cid:63) is λ108. In contrast, the objective of ridge
regression at w = [1; 0] is likely to be close to 0.25 + λ. It follows that whenever
108−1 ≈ 0.25 × 10−8, the objective of ridge regression is smaller at the
λ > 0.25
suboptimal solution w = [1; 0]. Since λ typically should be at least 1/m (see
the analysis in Chapter 13), it follows that in the aforementioned example, if the
number of examples is smaller than 108 then we are likely to output a suboptimal
solution.

The crux of the preceding example is that the two features have completely
diﬀerent scales. Feature normalization can overcome this problem. There are
many ways to perform feature normalization, and one of the simplest approaches
is simply to make sure that each feature receives values between −1 and 1. In
the preceding example, if we divide each feature by the maximal value it attains

366

we will obtain that x1 = y+0.5α
ridge regression is quite close to w(cid:63).

and x2 = y. Then, for λ ≤ 10−3 the solution of

Moreover, the generalization bounds we have derived in Chapter 13 for reg-
ularized loss minimization depend on the norm of the optimal vector w(cid:63) and
on the maximal norm of the instance vectors.2 Therefore, in the aforementioned
example, before we normalize the features we have that (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 = 108, while af-
ter we normalize the features we have that (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 = 1. The maximal norm of
the instance vector remains roughly the same; hence the normalization greatly
improves the estimation error.

Feature normalization can also improve the runtime of the learning algorithm.
For example, in Section 14.5.3 we have shown how to use the Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) optimization algorithm for solving the regularized loss minimiza-
tion problem. The number of iterations required by SGD to converge also depends
on the norm of w(cid:63) and on the maximal norm of (cid:107)x(cid:107). Therefore, as before, using
normalization can greatly decrease the runtime of SGD.

Next, we demonstrate in the following how a simple transformation on features,
such as clipping, can sometime decrease the approximation error of our hypoth-
esis class. Consider again linear regression with the squared loss. Let a > 1 be
a large number, suppose that the target y is chosen uniformly at random from
{±1}, and then the single feature x is set to be y with probability (1 − 1/a)
and set to be ay with probability 1/a. That is, most of the time our feature is
bounded but with a very small probability it gets a very high value. Then, for
any w, the expected squared loss of w is

Solving for w we obtain that w(cid:63) = 2a−1
a2+a−1 , which goes to zero as a goes to inﬁn-
ity. Therefore, the objective at w(cid:63) goes to 0.5 as a goes to inﬁnity. For example,
for a = 100 we will obtain LD(w(cid:63)) ≥ 0.48. Next, suppose we apply a “clipping”
transformation; that is, we use the transformation x (cid:55)→ sign(x) min{1,|x|}. Then,
following this transformation, w(cid:63) becomes 1 and LD(w(cid:63)) = 0. This simple ex-
ample shows that a simple transformation can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
approximation error.

Of course, it is not hard to think of examples in which the same feature trans-
formation actually hurts performance and increases the approximation error.
This is not surprising, as we have already argued that feature transformations

2 More precisely, the bounds we derived in Chapter 13 for regularized loss minimization

depend on (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 and on either the Lipschitzness or the smoothness of the loss function.
For linear predictors and loss functions of the form (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = φ((cid:104)w, x(cid:105), y), where φ is
convex and either 1-Lipschitz or 1-smooth with respect to its ﬁrst argument, we have that
(cid:96) is either (cid:107)x(cid:107)-Lipschitz or (cid:107)x(cid:107)2-smooth. For example, for the squared loss,
φ(a, y) = 1

should rely on our prior assumptions on the problem. In the aforementioned ex-
ample, a prior assumption that may lead us to use the “clipping” transformation
is that features that get values larger than a predeﬁned threshold value give us no
additional useful information, and therefore we can clip them to the predeﬁned
threshold.

25.2.1

Examples of Feature Transformations

We now list several common techniques for feature transformations. Usually, it
is helpful to combine some of these transformations (e.g., centering + scaling).
In the following, we denote by f = (f1, . . . , fm) ∈ Rm the value of the feature f
over the m training examples. Also, we denote by ¯f = 1
i=1 fi the empirical
m
mean of the feature over all examples.

(cid:80)m

Centering:
This transformation makes the feature have zero mean, by setting fi ← fi − ¯f .

Unit Range:
This transformation makes the range of each feature be [0, 1]. Formally, let
fmax = maxi fi and fmin = mini fi. Then, we set fi ← fi−fmin
. Similarly,
fmax−fmin
we can make the range of each feature be [−1, 1] by the transformation fi ←
− 1. Of course, it is easy to make the range [0, b] or [−b, b], where b is
2 fi−fmin
fmax−fmin
a user-speciﬁed parameter.

(cid:80)m
Standardization:
This transformation makes all features have a zero mean and unit variance.
i=1(fi − ¯f )2 be the empirical variance of the feature.
Formally, let ν = 1
m
Then, we set fi ← fi− ¯f√
ν .

Clipping:
This transformation clips high or low values of the feature. For example, fi ←
sign(fi) max{b,|fi|}, where b is a user-speciﬁed parameter.

Sigmoidal Transformation:
As its name indicates, this transformation applies a sigmoid function on the
feature. For example, fi ←
1+exp(b fi) , where b is a user-speciﬁed parameter.
This transformation can be thought of as a “soft” version of clipping: It has a
small eﬀect on values close to zero and behaves similarly to clipping on values
far away from zero.

1

368

Feature Selection and Generation

Logarithmic Transformation:
The transformation is fi ← log(b+fi), where b is a user-speciﬁed parameter. This
is widely used when the feature is a “counting” feature. For example, suppose
that the feature represents the number of appearances of a certain word in a
text document. Then, the diﬀerence between zero occurrences of the word and
a single occurrence is much more important than the diﬀerence between 1000
occurrences and 1001 occurrences.

Remark 25.5
In the aforementioned transformations, each feature is trans-
formed on the basis of the values it obtains on the training set, independently
of other features’ values. In some situations we would like to set the parameter
of the transformation on the basis of other features as well. A notable example
is a transformation in which one applies a scaling to the features so that the
empirical average of some norm of the instances becomes 1.

25.3

Feature Learning

So far we have discussed feature selection and manipulations. In these cases, we
start with a predeﬁned vector space Rd, representing our features. Then, we select
a subset of features (feature selection) or transform individual features (feature
transformation). In this section we describe feature learning, in which we start
with some instance space, X , and would like to learn a function, ψ : X → Rd,
which maps instances in X into a representation as d-dimensional feature vectors.
The idea of feature learning is to automate the process of ﬁnding a good rep-
resentation of the input space. As mentioned before, the No-Free-Lunch theorem
tells us that we must incorporate some prior knowledge on the data distribution
in order to build a good feature representation. In this section we present a few
feature learning approaches and demonstrate conditions on the underlying data
distribution in which these methods can be useful.

Throughout the book we have already seen several useful feature construc-
tions. For example, in the context of polynomial regression, we have mapped the
original instances into the vector space of all their monomials (see Section 9.2.2
in Chapter 9). After performing this mapping, we trained a linear predictor on
top of the constructed features. Automation of this process would be to learn
a transformation ψ : X → Rd, such that the composition of the class of linear
predictors on top of ψ yields a good hypothesis class for the task at hand.

In the following we describe a technique of feature construction called dictio-

nary learning.

25.3.1

Dictionary Learning Using Auto-Encoders

The motivation of dictionary learning stems from a commonly used represen-
tation of documents as a “bag-of-words”: Given a dictionary of words D =
{w1, . . . , wk}, where each wi is a string representing a word in the dictionary,

25.3 Feature Learning

369

and given a document, (p1, . . . , pd), where each pi is a word in the document,
we represent the document as a vector x ∈ {0, 1}k, where xi is 1 if wi = pj for
some j ∈ [d], and xi = 0 otherwise. It was empirically observed in many text
processing tasks that linear predictors are quite powerful when applied on this
representation. Intuitively, we can think of each word as a feature that measures
some aspect of the document. Given labeled examples (e.g., topics of the doc-
uments), a learning algorithm searches for a linear predictor that weights these
features so that a right combination of appearances of words is indicative of the
label.

While in text processing there is a natural meaning to words and to the dic-
tionary, in other applications we do not have such an intuitive representation
of an instance. For example, consider the computer vision application of object
recognition. Here, the instance is an image and the goal is to recognize which
object appears in the image. Applying a linear predictor on the pixel-based rep-
resentation of the image does not yield a good classiﬁer. What we would like
to have is a mapping ψ that would take the pixel-based representation of the
image and would output a bag of “visual words,” representing the content of the
image. For example, a “visual word” can be “there is an eye in the image.” If
we had such representation, we could have applied a linear predictor on top of
this representation to train a classiﬁer for, say, face recognition. Our question is,
therefore, how can we learn a dictionary of “visual words” such that a bag-of-
words representation of an image would be helpful for predicting which object
appears in the image?

A ﬁrst naive approach for dictionary learning relies on a clustering algorithm
(see Chapter 22). Suppose that we learn a function c : X → {1, . . . , k}, where
c(x) is the cluster to which x belongs. Then, we can think of the clusters as
“words,” and of instances as “documents,” where a document x is mapped to
the vector ψ(x) ∈ {0, 1}k, where ψ(x)i is 1 if and only if x belongs to the ith
cluster. Now, it is straightforward to see that applying a linear predictor on ψ(x)
is equivalent to assigning the same target value to all instances that belong to
the same cluster. Furthermore, if the clustering is based on distances from a
class center (e.g., k-means), then a linear predictor on ψ(x) yields a piece-wise
constant predictor on x.

ﬁnd a pair of functions such that the reconstruction error,(cid:80)

Both the k-means and PCA approaches can be regarded as special cases of a
more general approach for dictionary learning which is called auto-encoders. In an
auto-encoder we learn a pair of functions: an “encoder” function, ψ : Rd → Rk,
and a “decoder” function, φ : Rk → Rd. The goal of the learning process is to
i (cid:107)xi − φ(ψ(xi))(cid:107)2,
is small. Of course, we can trivially set k = d and both ψ, φ to be the identity
mapping, which yields a perfect reconstruction. We therefore must restrict ψ and
φ in some way. In PCA, we constrain k < d and further restrict ψ and φ to be
linear functions. In k-means, k is not restricted to be smaller than d, but now
ψ and φ rely on k centroids, µ1, . . . , µk, and ψ(x) returns an indicator vector

370

Feature Selection and Generation

in {0, 1}k that indicates the closest centroid to x, while φ takes as input an
indicator vector and returns the centroid representing this vector.

An important property of the k-means construction, which is key in allowing
k to be larger than d, is that ψ maps instances into sparse vectors. In fact, in
k-means only a single coordinate of ψ(x) is nonzero. An immediate extension of
the k-means construction is therefore to restrict the range of ψ to be vectors with
at most s nonzero elements, where s is a small integer. In particular, let ψ and φ
be functions that depend on µ1, . . . , µk. The function ψ maps an instance vector
x to a vector ψ(x) ∈ Rk, where ψ(x) should have at most s nonzero elements.

where (cid:107)v(cid:107)0 = |{j : vj (cid:54)= 0}|. Note that when s = 1 and we further restrict (cid:107)v(cid:107)1 =
1 then we obtain the k-means encoding function; that is, ψ(x) is the indicator
vector of the centroid closest to x. For larger values of s, the optimization problem
in the preceding deﬁnition of ψ becomes computationally diﬃcult. Therefore, in
practice, we sometime use (cid:96)1 regularization instead of the sparsity constraint and
deﬁne ψ to be

where λ > 0 is a regularization parameter. Anyway, the dictionary learning
problem is now to ﬁnd the vectors µ1, . . . , µk such that the reconstruction er-
i=1 (cid:107)xi − φ(ψ(x))(cid:107)2, is as small as possible. Even if ψ is deﬁned using
the (cid:96)1 regularization, this is still a computationally hard problem (similar to
the k-means problem). However, several heuristic search algorithms may give
reasonably good solutions. These algorithms are beyond the scope of this book.

Summary

Many machine learning algorithms take the feature representation of instances
for granted. Yet the choice of representation requires careful attention. We dis-
cussed approaches for feature selection, introducing ﬁlters, greedy selection al-
gorithms, and sparsity-inducing norms. Next we presented several examples for
feature transformations and demonstrated their usefulness. Last, we discussed
feature learning, and in particular dictionary learning. We have shown that fea-
ture selection, manipulation, and learning all depend on some prior knowledge
on the data.

Bibliographic Remarks

Guyon & Elisseeﬀ (2003) surveyed several feature selection procedures, including
many types of ﬁlters.

Forward greedy selection procedures for minimizing a convex objective sub-
ject to a polyhedron constraint date back to the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (Frank
& Wolfe 1956). The relation to boosting has been studied by several authors,
including, (Warmuth, Liao & Ratsch 2006, Warmuth, Glocer & Vishwanathan
2008, Shalev-Shwartz & Singer 2008). Matching pursuit has been studied in the
signal processing community (Mallat & Zhang 1993). Several papers analyzed
greedy selection methods under various conditions. See, for example, Shalev-
Shwartz, Zhang & Srebro (2010) and the references therein.

The use of the (cid:96)1-norm as a surrogate for sparsity has a long history (e.g. Tib-
shirani (1996) and the references therein), and much work has been done on un-
derstanding the relationship between the (cid:96)1-norm and sparsity. It is also closely
related to compressed sensing (see Chapter 23). The ability to sparsify low (cid:96)1
norm predictors dates back to Maurey (Pisier 1980-1981). In Section 26.4 we
also show that low (cid:96)1 norm can be used to bound the estimation error of our
predictor.

Feature learning and dictionary learning have been extensively studied recently
in the context of deep neural networks. See, for example, (Lecun & Bengio 1995,
Hinton et al. 2006, Ranzato et al. 2007, Collobert & Weston 2008, Lee et al.
2009, Le et al. 2012, Bengio 2009) and the references therein.

26 Rademacher Complexities

In Chapter 4 we have shown that uniform convergence is a suﬃcient condition
for learnability. In this chapter we study the Rademacher complexity, which
measures the rate of uniform convergence. We will provide generalization bounds
based on this measure.

26.1

The Rademacher Complexity

Recall the deﬁnition of an -representative sample from Chapter 4, repeated here
for convenience.

definition 26.1 (-Representative Sample) A training set S is called -representative
(w.r.t. domain Z, hypothesis class H, loss function (cid:96), and distribution D) if

|LD(h) − LS(h)| ≤ .

sup
h∈H

We have shown that if S is an /2 representative sample then the ERM rule

is -consistent, namely, LD(ERMH(S)) ≤ minh∈H LD(h) + .

To simplify our notation, let us denote

F def= (cid:96) ◦ H def= {z (cid:55)→ (cid:96)(h, z) : h ∈ H},

and given f ∈ F, we deﬁne

LD(f ) = E

We deﬁne the representativeness of S with respect to F as the largest gap be-
tween the true error of a function f and its empirical error, namely,

RepD(F, S) def= sup
f∈F

(cid:0)LD(f ) − LS(f )(cid:1).

Now, suppose we would like to estimate the representativeness of S using the
sample S only. One simple idea is to split S into two disjoint sets, S = S1 ∪ S2;
refer to S1 as a validation set and to S2 as a training set. We can then estimate
the representativeness of S by

(cid:0)LS1(f ) − LS2(f )(cid:1).

This can be written more compactly by deﬁning σ = (σ1, . . . , σm) ∈ {±1}m to

be the set of all possible evaluations a function f ∈ F can achieve on a sample
S, namely,

F ◦ S = {(f (z1), . . . , f (zm)) : f ∈ F}.

Let the variables in σ be distributed i.i.d. according to P[σi = 1] = P[σi = −1] =

Furthermore, if h(cid:63) = argminh LD(h) then for each δ ∈ (0, 1) with probability of
at least 1 − δ over the choice of S we have

equality follows because for any ﬁxed h(cid:63),

The third inequality follows from the previous inequality by relying on Markov’s
inequality (note that the random variable LD(ERMH(S)) − LD(h(cid:63)) is nonnega-
tive).

Next, we derive bounds similar to the bounds in Theorem 26.3 with a better
dependence on the conﬁdence parameter δ. To do so, we ﬁrst introduce the
following bounded diﬀerences concentration inequality.
lemma 26.4 (McDiarmid’s Inequality) Let V be some set and let f : V m → R
be a function of m variables such that for some c > 0, for all i ∈ [m] and for all
x1, . . . , xm, x(cid:48)

i ∈ V we have
|f (x1, . . . , xm) − f (x1, . . . , xi−1, x(cid:48)

i, xi+1, . . . , xm)| ≤ c.

Let X1, . . . , Xm be m independent random variables taking values in V . Then,
with probability of at least 1 − δ we have

|f (X1, . . . , Xm) − E[f (X1, . . . , Xm)]| ≤ c

On the basis of the McDiarmid inequality we can derive generalization bounds

with a better dependence on the conﬁdence parameter.
theorem 26.5 Assume that for all z and h ∈ H we have that |(cid:96)(h, z)| ≤ c.
Then,
1. With probability of at least 1 − δ, for all h ∈ H,

(cid:114)

(cid:114)

Proof First note that the random variable RepD(F, S) = suph∈H (LD(h) − LS(h))
satisﬁes the bounded diﬀerences condition of Lemma 26.4 with a constant 2c/m.
Combining the bounds in Lemma 26.4 with Lemma 26.2 we obtain that with
probability of at least 1 − δ,

2 ln(2/δ)

≤ 2 E

m

S(cid:48) R((cid:96) ◦ H ◦ S(cid:48)) + c

RepD(F, S) ≤ E RepD(F, S) + c
.
The ﬁrst inequality of the theorem follows from the deﬁnition of RepD(F, S).
For the second inequality we note that the random variable R((cid:96) ◦ H ◦ S) also
satisﬁes the bounded diﬀerences condition of Lemma 26.4 with a constant 2c/m.
Therefore, the second inequality follows from the ﬁrst inequality, Lemma 26.4,
and the union bound. Finally, for the last inequality, denote hS = ERMH(S)
and note that

2 ln(2/δ)

m

LD(hS) − LD(h(cid:63))

= LD(hS) − LS(hS) + LS(hS) − LS(h(cid:63)) + LS(h(cid:63)) − LD(h(cid:63))
≤ (LD(hS) − LS(hS)) + (LS(h(cid:63)) − LD(h(cid:63))) .

(26.10)

The ﬁrst summand on the right-hand side is bounded by the second inequality of
the theorem. For the second summand, we use the fact that h(cid:63) does not depend
on S; hence by using Hoeﬀding’s inequality we obtain that with probaility of at
least 1 − δ/2,

(cid:114)

LS(h(cid:63)) − LD(h(cid:63)) ≤ c

ln(4/δ)

2m

.

(26.11)

Combining this with the union bound we conclude our proof.

The preceding theorem tells us that if the quantity R((cid:96)◦H◦ S) is small then it
is possible to learn the class H using the ERM rule. It is important to emphasize
that the last two bounds given in the theorem depend on the speciﬁc training
set S. That is, we use S both for learning a hypothesis from H as well as for
estimating the quality of it. This type of bound is called a data-dependent bound.

26.1.1

Rademacher Calculus

Let us now discuss some properties of the Rademacher complexity measure.
These properties will help us in deriving some simple bounds on R((cid:96)◦H ◦ S) for
speciﬁc cases of interest.

The following lemma is immediate from the deﬁnition.

lemma 26.6 For any A ⊂ Rm, scalar c ∈ R, and vector a0 ∈ Rm, we have

R({c a + a0 : a ∈ A}) ≤ |c| R(A).

The following lemma tells us that the convex hull of A has the same complexity

as A.

N,∀j, a(j) ∈ A, αj ≥ 0,(cid:107)α(cid:107)1 = 1}. Then, R(A(cid:48)) = R(A).
Proof The main idea follows from the fact that for any vector v we have

The next lemma, due to Massart, states that the Rademacher complexity of

a ﬁnite set grows logarithmically with the size of the set.

proof.

The following lemma shows that composing A with a Lipschitz function does
not blow up the Rademacher complexity. The proof is due to Kakade and Tewari.

lemma 26.9 (Contraction lemma) For each i ∈ [m], let φi : R → R be a ρ-
Lipschitz function, namely for all α, β ∈ R we have |φi(α) − φi(β)| ≤ ρ|α − β|.
For a ∈ Rm let φ(a) denote the vector (φ1(a1), . . . , φm(ym)). Let φ◦ A = {φ(a) :
a ∈ A}. Then,

R(φ ◦ A) ≤ ρ R(A).

Proof For simplicity, we prove the lemma for the case ρ = 1. The case ρ (cid:54)=
1 will follow by deﬁning φ(cid:48) = 1
ρ φ and then using Lemma 26.6. Let Ai =
{(a1, . . . , ai−1, φi(ai), ai+1, . . . , am) : a ∈ A}. Clearly, it suﬃces to prove that
for any set A and all i we have R(Ai) ≤ R(A). Without loss of generality we will
prove the latter claim for i = 1 and to simplify notation we omit the subscript
from φ1. We have

proof.

26.2

Rademacher Complexity of Linear Classes

,

In this section we analyze the Rademacher complexity of linear classes. To sim-
plify the derivation we ﬁrst deﬁne the following two classes:
H1 = {x (cid:55)→ (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) : (cid:107)w(cid:107)1 ≤ 1}
H2 = {x (cid:55)→ (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ 1}. (26.14)
The following lemma bounds the Rademacher complexity of H2. We allow
the xi to be vectors in any Hilbert space (even inﬁnite dimensional), and the
bound does not depend on the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. This property
becomes useful when analyzing kernel methods.
lemma 26.10 Let S = (x1, . . . , xm) be vectors in a Hilbert space. Deﬁne: H2 ◦
S = {((cid:104)w, x1(cid:105), . . . ,(cid:104)w, xm(cid:105)) : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ 1}. Then,

Generalization Bounds for SVM

In this section we use Rademacher complexity to derive generalization bounds
for generalized linear predictors with Euclidean norm constraint. We will show
how this leads to generalization bounds for hard-SVM and soft-SVM.

384

Rademacher Complexities

We shall consider the following general constraint-based formulation. Let H =
{w : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ B} be our hypothesis class, and let Z = X × Y be the examples
domain. Assume that the loss function (cid:96) : H × Z → R is of the form

(cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = φ((cid:104)w, x(cid:105), y),

(26.18)
where φ : R × Y → R is such that for all y ∈ Y, the scalar function a (cid:55)→ φ(a, y)
is ρ-Lipschitz. For example, the hinge-loss function, (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = max{0, 1 −
y(cid:104)w, x(cid:105)}, can be written as in Equation (26.18) using φ(a, y) = max{0, 1 −
ya}, and note that φ is 1-Lipschitz for all y ∈ {±1}. Another example is the
absolute loss function, (cid:96)(w, (x, y)) = |(cid:104)w, x(cid:105) − y|, which can be written as in
Equation (26.18) using φ(a, y) = |a − y|, which is also 1-Lipschitz for all y ∈ R.
The following theorem bounds the generalization error of all predictors in H

using their empirical error.
theorem 26.12 Suppose that D is a distribution over X × Y such that with
probability 1 we have that (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 ≤ R. Let H = {w : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ B} and let
(cid:96) : H × Z → R be a loss function of the form given in Equation (26.18)
such that for all y ∈ Y, a (cid:55)→ φ(a, y) is a ρ-Lipschitz function and such that
maxa∈[−BR,BR] |φ(a, y)| ≤ c. Then, for any δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability of at least
1 − δ over the choice of an i.i.d. sample of size m,

(cid:114)

∀w ∈ H, LD(w) ≤ LS(w) +

Proof Let F = {(x, y) (cid:55)→ φ((cid:104)w, x(cid:105), y) : w ∈ H}. We will show that with
√
probability 1, R(F ◦ S) ≤ ρBR/
m and then the theorem will follow from
Theorem 26.5. Indeed, the set F ◦ S can be written as

F ◦ S = {(φ((cid:104)w, x1(cid:105), y1), . . . , φ((cid:104)w, xm(cid:105), ym)) : w ∈ H},

and the bound on R(F◦S) follows directly by combining Lemma 26.9, Lemma 26.10,
and the assumption that (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 ≤ R with probability 1.

We next derive a generalization bound for hard-SVM based on the previous
theorem. For simplicity, we do not allow a bias term and consider the hard-SVM
problem:

probability 1. Let wS be the output of Equation (26.19). Then, with probability
of at least 1 − δ over the choice of S ∼ Dm, we have that

Proof Throughout the proof, let the loss function be the ramp loss (see Sec-
tion 15.2.3). Note that the range of the ramp loss is [0, 1] and that it is a
1-Lipschitz function. Since the ramp loss upper bounds the zero-one loss, we
have that

Let B = (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)2 and consider the set H = {w : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ B}. By the deﬁnition of
hard-SVM and our assumption on the distribution, we have that wS ∈ H with
probability 1 and that LS(wS) = 0. Therefore, using Theorem 26.12 we have

Remark 26.1 Theorem 26.13 implies that the sample complexity of hard-SVM
grows like R2 (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)2
. Using a more delicate analysis and the separability assump-
tion, it is possible to improve the bound to an order of R2 (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107)2

The bound in the preceding theorem depends on (cid:107)w(cid:63)(cid:107), which is unknown.
In the following we derive a bound that depends on the norm of the output of
SVM; hence it can be calculated from the training set itself. The proof is similar
to the derivation of bounds for structure risk minimization (SRM).

Remark 26.2 Note that all the bounds we have derived do not depend on the
dimension of w. This property is utilized when learning SVM with kernels, where
the dimension of w can be extremely large.

Generalization Bounds for Predictors with Low (cid:96)1 Norm

In the previous section we derived generalization bounds for linear predictors
with an (cid:96)2-norm constraint. In this section we consider the following general (cid:96)1-
norm constraint formulation. Let H = {w : (cid:107)w(cid:107)1 ≤ B} be our hypothesis class,
and let Z = X × Y be the examples domain. Assume that the loss function,
(cid:96) : H × Z → R, is of the same form as in Equation (26.18), with φ : R × Y → R
being ρ-Lipschitz w.r.t. its ﬁrst argument. The following theorem bounds the
generalization error of all predictors in H using their empirical error.
theorem 26.15 Suppose that D is a distribution over X × Y such that with
probability 1 we have that (cid:107)x(cid:107)∞ ≤ R. Let H = {w ∈ Rd : (cid:107)w(cid:107)1 ≤ B} and
let (cid:96) : H × Z → R be a loss function of the form given in Equation (26.18)
such that for all y ∈ Y, a (cid:55)→ φ(a, y) is an ρ-Lipschitz function and such that
maxa∈[−BR,BR] |φ(a, y)| ≤ c. Then, for any δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability of at least
1 − δ over the choice of an i.i.d. sample of size m,

Proof The proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 26.12, while relying on
Lemma 26.11 instead of relying on Lemma 26.10.

It is interesting to compare the two bounds given in Theorem 26.12 and The-
orem 26.15. Apart from the extra log(d) factor that appears in Theorem 26.15,
both bounds look similar. However, the parameters B, R have diﬀerent meanings
in the two bounds. In Theorem 26.12, the parameter B imposes an (cid:96)2 constraint
on w and the parameter R captures a low (cid:96)2-norm assumption on the instances.
In contrast, in Theorem 26.15 the parameter B imposes an (cid:96)1 constraint on w
(which is stronger than an (cid:96)2 constraint) while the parameter R captures a low
(cid:96)∞-norm assumption on the instance (which is weaker than a low (cid:96)2-norm as-
sumption). Therefore, the choice of the constraint should depend on our prior
knowledge of the set of instances and on prior assumptions on good predictors.

26.5

Bibliographic Remarks

The use of Rademacher complexity for bounding the uniform convergence is
due to (Koltchinskii & Panchenko 2000, Bartlett & Mendelson 2001, Bartlett
& Mendelson 2002). For additional reading see, for example, (Bousquet 2002,
Boucheron, Bousquet & Lugosi 2005, Bartlett, Bousquet & Mendelson 2005).

26.5 Bibliographic Remarks

387

Our proof of the concentration lemma is due to Kakade and Tewari lecture
notes. Kakade, Sridharan & Tewari (2008) gave a uniﬁed framework for deriving
bounds on the Rademacher complexity of linear classes with respect to diﬀerent
assumptions on the norms.

27 Covering Numbers

In this chapter we describe another way to measure the complexity of sets, which
is called covering numbers.

27.1

Covering
definition 27.1 (Covering) Let A ⊂ Rm be a set of vectors. We say that A
is r-covered by a set A(cid:48), with respect to the Euclidean metric, if for all a ∈ A
there exists a(cid:48) ∈ A(cid:48) with (cid:107)a − a(cid:48)(cid:107) ≤ r. We deﬁne by N (r, A) the cardinality of
the smallest A(cid:48) that r-covers A.
Example 27.1 (Subspace) Suppose that A ⊂ Rm, let c = maxa∈A (cid:107)a(cid:107), and as-
√
sume that A lies in a d-dimensional subspace of Rm. Then, N (r, A) ≤ (2c
d/r)d.
To see this, let v1, . . . , vd be an orthonormal basis of the subspace. Then, any
i=1 αivi with (cid:107)α(cid:107)∞ ≤ (cid:107)α(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)a(cid:107)2 ≤ c. Let
 ∈ R and consider the set

27.2 From Covering to Rademacher Complexity via Chaining

389

Next, we derive a contraction principle.
lemma 27.3 For each i ∈ [m], let φi
: R → R be a ρ-Lipschitz function;
namely, for all α, β ∈ R we have |φi(α) − φi(β)| ≤ ρ|α − β|. For a ∈ Rm let
φ(a) denote the vector (φ1(a1), . . . , φm(am)). Let φ◦ A = {φ(a) : a ∈ A}. Then,

N (ρ r, φ ◦ A) ≤ N (r, A).

Proof Deﬁne B = φ ◦ A. Let A(cid:48) be an r-cover of A and deﬁne B(cid:48) = φ ◦ A(cid:48).
Then, for all a ∈ A there exists a(cid:48) ∈ A(cid:48) with (cid:107)a − a(cid:48)(cid:107) ≤ r. So,
(ai − a(cid:48)

i))2 ≤ ρ2(cid:88)

(cid:107)φ(a) − φ(a(cid:48))(cid:107)2 =

(φi(ai) − φi(a(cid:48)

i)2 ≤ (ρr)2.

(cid:88)

Hence, B(cid:48) is an (ρ r)-cover of B.

From Covering to Rademacher Complexity via Chaining

The following lemma bounds the Rademacher complexity of A based on the
covering numbers N (r, A). This technique is called Chaining and is attributed
to Dudley.

Proof Let ¯a be a minimizer of the objective function given in the deﬁnition
of c. On the basis of Lemma 26.6, we can analyze the Rademacher complexity
assuming that ¯a = 0.
Consider the set B0 = {0} and note that it is a c-cover of A. Let B1, . . . , BM
be sets such that each Bk corresponds to a minimal (c 2−k)-cover of A. Let
a∗ = argmaxa∈A(cid:104)σ, a(cid:105) (where if there is more than one maximizer, choose one
in an arbitrary way, and if a maximizer does not exist, choose a∗ such that
(cid:104)σ, a∗(cid:105) is close enough to the supremum). Note that a∗ is a function of σ. For
each k, let b(k) be the nearest neighbor of a∗ in Bk (hence b(k) is also a function
of σ). Using the triangle inequality,
(cid:107)b(k) − b(k−1)(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)b(k) − a∗(cid:107) + (cid:107)a∗ − b(k−1)(cid:107) ≤ c (2−k + 2−(k−1)) = 3 c 2−k.

For each k deﬁne the set

ˆBk = {(a − a(cid:48)) : a ∈ Bk, a(cid:48) ∈ Bk−1,(cid:107)a − a(cid:48)(cid:107) ≤ 3 c 2−k}.

Bibliographic Remarks

The chaining technique is due to Dudley (1987). For an extensive study of cover-
ing numbers as well as other complexity measures that can be used to bound the
rate of uniform convergence we refer the reader to (Anthony & Bartlet 1999).

28 Proof of the Fundamental Theorem

of Learning Theory

In this chapter we prove Theorem 6.8 from Chapter 6. We remind the reader
the conditions of the theorem, which will hold throughout this chapter: H is a
hypothesis class of functions from a domain X to {0, 1}, the loss function is the
0 − 1 loss, and VCdim(H) = d < ∞.

We shall prove the upper bound for both the realizable and agnostic cases
and shall prove the lower bound for the agnostic case. The lower bound for the
realizable case is left as an exercise.

28.1

The Upper Bound for the Agnostic Case
For the upper bound we need to prove that there exists C such that H is agnostic
PAC learnable with sample complexity
mH(, δ) ≤ C

.

2

We will prove the slightly looser bound:

mH(, δ) ≤ C

d log(d/) + ln(1/δ)

2

.

(28.1)

The tighter bound in the theorem statement requires a more involved proof, in
which a more careful analysis of the Rademacher complexity using a technique
called “chaining” should be used. This is beyond the scope of this book.

To prove Equation (28.1), it suﬃces to show that applying the ERM with a

Let (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym) be a classiﬁcation training set. Recall that the Sauer-
Shelah lemma tells us that if VCdim(H) = d then

learnable.

Choose one example that is shattered by H. That is, let c be an example such

that there are h+, h− ∈ H for which h+(c) = 1 and h−(c) = −1. Deﬁne two

and the probability of (c,−b) is

2 .
Let A be an arbitrary algorithm. Any training set sampled from Db has the
form S = (c, y1), . . . , (c, ym). Therefore, it is fully characterized by the vector
y = (y1, . . . , ym) ∈ {±1}m. Upon receiving a training set S, the algorithm A
returns a hypothesis h : X → {±1}. Since the error of A w.r.t. Db only depends
on h(c), we can think of A as a mapping from {±1}m into {±1}. Therefore,
we denote by A(y) the value in {±1} corresponding to the prediction of h(c),
where h is the hypothesis that A outputs upon receiving the training set S =
(c, y1), . . . , (c, ym).

Note that for any hypothesis h we have

LDb (h) =

is the Maximum-Likelihood learning rule, denoted AM L. Formally, for each i,
AM L(S)(ci) is the majority vote among the set {yr : r ∈ [m], xr = ci}. Second,
we lower bound Equation (28.7) for AM L.

But, since we now assume S ∈ B we know that D(hS) = ρ ≥ . Therefore,
|T ∩ hS| is a binomial random variable with parameters ρ (probability of success

P[|T∩hS| ≤ ρm
Thus,
P[|T ∩ hS| > m

concludes our proof.

29 Multiclass Learnability

In Chapter 17 we have introduced the problem of multiclass categorization, in
which the goal is to learn a predictor h : X → [k]. In this chapter we address PAC
learnability of multiclass predictors with respect to the 0-1 loss. As in Chapter 6,
the main goal of this chapter is to:
• Characterize which classes of multiclass hypotheses are learnable in the (mul-

ticlass) PAC model.

• Quantify the sample complexity of such hypothesis classes.

In view of the fundamental theorem of learning theory (Theorem 6.8), it is natu-
ral to seek a generalization of the VC dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes.
In Section 29.1 we show such a generalization, called the Natarajan dimension,
and state a generalization of the fundamental theorem based on the Natarajan
dimension. Then, we demonstrate how to calculate the Natarajan dimension of
several important hypothesis classes.

Recall that the main message of the fundamental theorem of learning theory
is that a hypothesis class of binary classiﬁers is learnable (with respect to the
0-1 loss) if and only if it has the uniform convergence property, and then it
is learnable by any ERM learner. In Chapter 13, Exercise 2, we have shown
that this equivalence breaks down for a certain convex learning problem. The
last section of this chapter is devoted to showing that the equivalence between
learnability and uniform convergence breaks down even in multiclass problems
with the 0-1 loss, which are very similar to binary classiﬁcation. Indeed, we
construct a hypothesis class which is learnable by a speciﬁc ERM learner, but
for which other ERM learners might fail and the uniform convergence property
does not hold.

29.1

The Natarajan Dimension

In this section we deﬁne the Natarajan dimension, which is a generalization of
the VC dimension to classes of multiclass predictors. Throughout this section,
let H be a hypothesis class of multiclass predictors; namely, each h ∈ H is a
function from X to [k].

29.2 The Multiclass Fundamental Theorem

403

To deﬁne the Natarajan dimension, we ﬁrst generalize the deﬁnition of shat-

tering.
definition 29.1 (Shattering (Multiclass Version)) We say that a set C ⊂ X
is shattered by H if there exist two functions f0, f1 : C → [k] such that
• For every x ∈ C, f0(x) (cid:54)= f1(x).
• For every B ⊂ C, there exists a function h ∈ H such that

∀x ∈ B, h(x) = f0(x) and ∀x ∈ C \ B, h(x) = f1(x).

definition 29.2 (Natarajan Dimension) The Natarajan dimension of H, de-
noted Ndim(H), is the maximal size of a shattered set C ⊂ X .

It is not hard to see that in the case that there are exactly two classes,
Ndim(H) = VCdim(H). Therefore, the Natarajan dimension generalizes the VC
dimension. We next show that the Natarajan dimension allows us to general-
ize the fundamental theorem of statistical learning from binary classiﬁcation to
multiclass classiﬁcation.

On the Proof of Theorem 29.3

The lower bounds in Theorem 29.3 can be deduced by a reduction from the
binary fundamental theorem (see Exercise 5).

The upper bounds in Theorem 29.3 can be proved along the same lines of the
proof of the fundamental theorem for binary classiﬁcation, given in Chapter 28
(see Exercise 4). The sole ingredient of that proof that should be modiﬁed in a
nonstraightforward manner is Sauer’s lemma. It applies only to binary classes
and therefore must be replaced. An appropriate substitute is Natarajan’s lemma:

404

Multiclass Learnability

lemma 29.4 (Natarajan)

|H| ≤ |X|Ndim(H) · k2Ndim(H).

The proof of Natarajan’s lemma shares the same spirit of the proof of Sauer’s

lemma and is left as an exercise (see Exercise 3).

29.3

Calculating the Natarajan Dimension

In this section we show how to calculate (or estimate) the Natarajan dimen-
sion of several popular classes, some of which were studied in Chapter 17. As
these calculations indicate, the Natarajan dimension is often proportional to the
number of parameters required to deﬁne a hypothesis.

29.3.1

One-versus-All Based Classes

In Chapter 17 we have seen two reductions of multiclass categorization to bi-
nary classiﬁcation: One-versus-All and All-Pairs. In this section we calculate the
Natarajan dimension of the One-versus-All method.

Recall that in One-versus-All we train, for each label, a binary classiﬁer that
distinguishes between that label and the rest of the labels. This naturally sug-
gests considering multiclass hypothesis classes of the following form. Let Hbin ⊂
{0, 1}X be a binary hypothesis class. For every ¯h = (h1, . . . , hk) ∈ (Hbin)k deﬁne
T (¯h) : X → [k] by

T (¯h)(x) = argmax

i∈[k]

hi(x).

If there are two labels that maximize hi(x), we choose the smaller one. Also, let

HOvA,k
bin = {T (¯h) : ¯h ∈ (Hbin)k}.
What “should” be the Natarajan dimension of HOvA,k
? Intuitively, to specify a
hypothesis in Hbin we need d = VCdim(Hbin) parameters. To specify a hypothe-
sis in HOvA,k
, we need to specify k hypotheses in Hbin. Therefore, kd parameters
should suﬃce. The following lemma establishes this intuition.

bin

If d = VCdim(Hbin) then

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ 2|C|.

How tight is Lemma 29.5? It is not hard to see that for some classes, Ndim(HOvA,k

bin
can be much smaller than dk (see Exercise 1). However there are several natural
binary classes, Hbin (e.g., halfspaces), for which Ndim(HOvA,k
) = Ω(dk) (see
Exercise 6).

29.3.2

General Multiclass-to-Binary Reductions

The same reasoning used to establish Lemma 29.5 can be used to upper bound
the Natarajan dimension of more general multiclass-to-binary reductions. These
reductions train several binary classiﬁers on the data. Then, given a new in-
stance, they predict its label by using some rule that takes into account the
labels predicted by the binary classiﬁers. These reductions include One-versus-
All and All-Pairs.
Suppose that such a method trains l binary classiﬁers from a binary class Hbin,
and r : {0, 1}l → [k] is the rule that determines the (multiclass) label according
to the predictions of the binary classiﬁers. The hypothesis class corresponding
to this method can be deﬁned as follows. For every ¯h = (h1, . . . , hl) ∈ (Hbin)l
deﬁne R(¯h) : X → [k] by

Finally, let

R(¯h)(x) = r(h1(x), . . . , hl(x)).

Hr
bin = {R(¯h) : ¯h ∈ (Hbin)l}.

Similarly to Lemma 29.5 it can be proven that:

lemma 29.6

If d = VCdim(Hbin) then

Ndim(Hr

bin) ≤ 3 l d log (l d) .

The proof is left as Exercise 2.

29.3.3

Linear Multiclass Predictors

Next, we consider the class of linear multiclass predictors (see Section 17.2). Let
Ψ : X × [k] → Rd be some class-sensitive feature mapping and let

(cid:40)

(cid:41)

HΨ =

x (cid:55)→ argmax
i∈[k]

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, i)(cid:105) : w ∈ Rd

.

(29.1)

Each hypothesis in HΨ is determined by d parameters, namely, a vector w ∈
Rd. Therefore, we would expect that the Natarajan dimension would be upper
bounded by d. Indeed:

406

Multiclass Learnability

theorem 29.7 Ndim(HΨ) ≤ d .
Proof Let C ⊂ X be a shattered set, and let f0, f1 : C → [k] be the two
functions that witness the shattering. We need to show that |C| ≤ d. For every
x ∈ C let ρ(x) = Ψ(x, f0(x)) − Ψ(x, f1(x)). We claim that the set ρ(C) def=
{ρ(x) : x ∈ C} consists of |C| elements (i.e., ρ is one to one) and is shattered
by the binary hypothesis class of homogeneous linear separators on Rd,

H = {x (cid:55)→ sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) : w ∈ Rd}.

Since VCdim(H) = d, it will follow that |C| = |ρ(C)| ≤ d, as required.
To establish our claim it is enough to show that |Hρ(C)| = 2|C|. Indeed, given
a subset B ⊂ C, by the deﬁnition of shattering, there exists hB ∈ HΨ for which

∀x ∈ B, hB(x) = f0(x)

and ∀x ∈ C \ B, hB(x) = f1(x).

Let wB ∈ Rd be a vector that deﬁnes hB. We have that, for every x ∈ B,

(cid:104)w, Ψ(x, f0(x))(cid:105) > (cid:104)w, Ψ(x, f1(x))(cid:105) ⇒ (cid:104)w, ρ(x)(cid:105) > 0.

Similarly, for every x ∈ C \ B,

(cid:104)w, ρ(x)(cid:105) < 0.

It follows that the hypothesis gB ∈ H deﬁned by the same w ∈ Rd label the
points in ρ(B) by 1 and the points in ρ(C \ B) by 0. Since this holds for every
B ⊆ C we obtain that |C| = |ρ(C)| and |Hρ(C)| = 2|C|, which concludes our
proof.

The theorem is tight in the sense that there are mappings Ψ for which Ndim(HΨ) =

Ω(d). For example, this is true for the multivector construction (see Section 17.2
and the Bibliographic Remarks at the end of this chapter). We therefore con-
clude:
corollary 29.8 Let X = Rn and let Ψ : X × [k] → Rnk be the class sensitive
feature mapping for the multi-vector construction:

(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)

Ψ(x, y) = [ 0, . . . , 0
∈R(y−1)n

].

Let HΨ be as deﬁned in Equation (29.1). Then, the Natarajan dimension of HΨ
satisﬁes

(k − 1)(n − 1) ≤ Ndim(HΨ) ≤ kn.

29.4

On Good and Bad ERMs

In this section we present an example of a hypothesis class with the property
that not all ERMs for the class are equally successful. Furthermore, if we allow
an inﬁnite number of labels, we will also obtain an example of a class that is

29.4 On Good and Bad ERMs

407

learnable by some ERM, but other ERMs will fail to learn it. Clearly, this also
implies that the class is learnable but it does not have the uniform convergence
property. For simplicity, we consider only the realizable case.
The class we consider is deﬁned as follows. The instance space X will be any
ﬁnite or countable set. Let Pf (X ) be the collection of all ﬁnite and coﬁnite
subsets of X (that is, for each A ∈ Pf (X ), either A or X \ A must be ﬁnite).
Instead of [k], the label set is Y = Pf (X ) ∪ {∗}, where ∗ is some special label.
For every A ∈ Pf (X ) deﬁne hA : X → Y by

(cid:40)

hA(x) =

A x ∈ A
∗
x /∈ A

Finally, the hypothesis class we take is

H = {hA : A ∈ Pf (X )}.

Let A be some ERM algorithm for H. Assume that A operates on a sample
labeled by hA ∈ H. Since hA is the only hypothesis in H that might return
the label A, if A observes the label A, it “knows” that the learned hypothesis
is hA, and, as an ERM, must return it (note that in this case the error of the
returned hypothesis is 0). Therefore, to specify an ERM, we should only specify
the hypothesis it returns upon receiving a sample of the form

S = {(x1,∗), . . . , (xm,∗)}.
We consider two ERMs: The ﬁrst, Agood, is deﬁned by

Agood(S) = h∅;

that is, it outputs the hypothesis which predicts ‘*’ for every x ∈ X . The second
ERM, Abad, is deﬁned by

Abad(S) = h{x1,...xm}c.

The following claim shows that the sample complexity of Abad is about |X|-times
larger than the sample complexity of Agood. This establishes a gap between
diﬀerent ERMs. If X is inﬁnite, we even obtain a learnable class that is not
learnable by every ERM.

Multiclass Learnability

Proof Let D be a distribution over X and suppose that the correct labeling
is hA. For any sample, Agood returns either h∅ or hA. If it returns hA then its
true error is zero. Thus, it returns a hypothesis with error ≥  only if all the m
examples in the sample are from X \ A while the error of h∅, LD(h∅) = PD[A],
is ≥ . Assume m ≥ 1

than (1 − )m ≤ e−m ≤ δ. This establishes item 1.
Next we prove item 2. We restrict the proof to the case that |X| = d < ∞.

The proof for inﬁnite X is similar. Suppose that X = {x0, . . . , xd−1}.
Let a > 0 be small enough such that 1 − 2 ≥ e−4 for every  < a and ﬁx
some  < a. Deﬁne a distribution on X by setting P[x0] = 1 − 2 and for all
1 ≤ i ≤ d− 1, P[xi] = 2
d−1 . Suppose that the correct hypothesis is h∅ and let the
sample size be m. Clearly, the hypothesis returned by Abad will err on all the
examples from X which are not in the sample. By Chernoﬀ’s bound, if m ≤ d−1

then with probability ≥ e− 1

The conclusion of the example presented is that in multiclass classiﬁcation,
the sample complexity of diﬀerent ERMs may diﬀer. Are there “good” ERMs
for every hypothesis class? The following conjecture asserts that the answer is
yes.

H ⊂ [k]

is

We emphasize that the ˜O notation may hide only poly-log factors of , δ, and
Ndim(H), but no factor of k.

29.5

Bibliographic Remarks

The Natarajan dimension is due to Natarajan (1989). That paper also established
the Natarajan lemma and the generalization of the fundamental theorem. Gen-
eralizations and sharper versions of the Natarajan lemma are studied in Haussler
& Long (1995). Ben-David, Cesa-Bianchi, Haussler & Long (1995) deﬁned a large
family of notions of dimensions, all of which generalize the VC dimension and
may be used to estimate the sample complexity of multiclass classiﬁcation.

The calculation of the Natarajan dimension, presented here, together with
calculation of other classes, can be found in Daniely et al. (2012). The example
of good and bad ERMs, as well as conjecture 29.10, are from Daniely et al.
(2011).

30 Compression Bounds

Throughout the book, we have tried to characterize the notion of learnability
using diﬀerent approaches. At ﬁrst we have shown that the uniform conver-
gence property of a hypothesis class guarantees successful learning. Later on we
introduced the notion of stability and have shown that stable algorithms are
guaranteed to be good learners. Yet there are other properties which may be
suﬃcient for learning, and in this chapter and its sequel we will introduce two
approaches to this issue: compression bounds and the PAC-Bayes approach.

In this chapter we study compression bounds. Roughly speaking, we shall see
that if a learning algorithm can express the output hypothesis using a small sub-
set of the training set, then the error of the hypothesis on the rest of the examples
estimates its true error. In other words, an algorithm that can “compress” its
output is a good learner.

30.1

Compression Bounds

To motivate the results, let us ﬁrst consider the following learning protocol.
First, we sample a sequence of k examples denoted T . On the basis of these
examples, we construct a hypothesis denoted hT . Now we would like to estimate
the performance of hT so we sample a fresh sequence of m− k examples, denoted
V , and calculate the error of hT on V . Since V and T are independent, we
immediately get the following from Bernstein’s inequality (see Lemma B.10).

lemma 30.1 Assume that the range of the loss function is [0, 1]. Then,

LD(hT ) − LV (hT ) ≥

≤ δ.

To derive this bound, all we needed was independence between T and V .
Therefore, we can redeﬁne the protocol as follows. First, we agree on a sequence
of k indices I = (i1, . . . , ik) ∈ [m]k. Then, we sample a sequence of m examples
S = (z1, . . . , zm). Now, deﬁne T = SI = (zi1, . . . , zik ) and deﬁne V to be the
rest of the examples in S. Note that this protocol is equivalent to the protocol
we deﬁned before – hence Lemma 30.1 still holds.

Applying a union bound over the choice of the sequence of indices we obtain

the following theorem.

of size m and returns a hypothesis such that A(S) = B(zi1, . . . , zik ) for some
(i1, . . . , ik) ∈ [m]k. Let V = {zj : j /∈ (i1, . . . , ik)} be the set of examples which
were not selected for deﬁning A(S). Then, with probability of at least 1 − δ over

These results motivate the following deﬁnition:

(Compression Scheme) Let H be a hypothesis class of
definition 30.4
functions from X to Y and let k be an integer. We say that H has a compression
scheme of size k if the following holds:
For all m there exists A : Z m → [m]k and B : Z k → H such that for all h ∈ H,
if we feed any training set of the form (x1, h(x1)), . . . , (xm, h(xm)) into A and
then feed (xi1 , h(xi1 )), . . . , (xik , h(xik )) into B, where (i1, . . . , ik) is the output
of A, then the output of B, denoted h(cid:48), satisﬁes LS(h(cid:48)) = 0.

It is possible to generalize the deﬁnition for unrealizable sequences as follows.

412

Compression Bounds

definition 30.5
(Compression Scheme for Unrealizable Sequences)
Let H be a hypothesis class of functions from X to Y and let k be an integer.
We say that H has a compression scheme of size k if the following holds:
For all m there exists A : Z m → [m]k and B : Z k → H such that for all h ∈ H,
if we feed any training set of the form (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym) into A and then
feed (xi1, yi1 ), . . . , (xik , yik ) into B, where (i1, . . . , ik) is the output of A, then
the output of B, denoted h(cid:48), satisﬁes LS(h(cid:48)) ≤ LS(h).

The following lemma shows that the existence of a compression scheme for
the realizable case also implies the existence of a compression scheme for the
unrealizable case.
lemma 30.6 Let H be a hypothesis class for binary classiﬁcation, and assume
it has a compression scheme of size k in the realizable case. Then, it has a
compression scheme of size k for the unrealizable case as well.

Proof Consider the following scheme: First, ﬁnd an ERM hypothesis and denote
it by h. Then, discard all the examples on which h errs. Now, apply the realizable
compression scheme on the examples that have not been removed. The output of
the realizable compression scheme, denoted h(cid:48), must be correct on the examples
that have not been removed. Since h errs on the removed examples it follows
that the error of h(cid:48) cannot be larger than the error of h; hence h(cid:48) is also an ERM
hypothesis.

30.2

Examples

In the examples that follows, we present compression schemes for several hy-
pothesis classes for binary classiﬁcation. In light of Lemma 30.6 we focus on the
realizable case. Therefore, to show that a certain hypothesis class has a com-
pression scheme, it is necessary to show that there exist A, B, and k for which
LS(h(cid:48)) = 0.

30.2.1

Axis Aligned Rectangles

Note that this is an uncountable inﬁnite class. We show that there is a simple
compression scheme. Consider the algorithm A that works as follows: For each
dimension, choose the two positive examples with extremal values at this dimen-
sion. Deﬁne B to be the function that returns the minimal enclosing rectangle.
Then, for k = 2d, we have that in the realizable case, LS(B(A(S))) = 0.

30.2.2

Halfspaces
Let X = Rd and consider the class of homogenous halfspaces, {x (cid:55)→ sign((cid:104)w, x(cid:105)) :
w ∈ Rd}.

30.2 Examples

413

A Compression Scheme:
W.l.o.g. assume all labels are positive (otherwise, replace xi by yixi). The com-
pression scheme we propose is as follows. First, A ﬁnds the vector w which is
in the convex hull of {x1, . . . , xm} and has minimal norm. Then, it represents it
as a convex combination of d points in the sample (it will be shown later that
this is always possible). The output of A are these d points. The algorithm B
receives these d points and set w to be the point in their convex hull of minimal
norm.
Next we prove that this indeed is a compression sceme. Since the data is
linearly separable, the convex hull of {x1, . . . , xm} does not contain the origin.
Consider the point w in this convex hull closest to the origin. (This is a unique
point which is the Euclidean projection of the origin onto this convex hull.) We
claim that w separates the data.1 To see this, assume by contradiction that
(cid:107)xi(cid:107)2+(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ∈ (0, 1).
(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105) ≤ 0 for some i. Take w(cid:48) = (1 − α)w + αxi for α =
Then w(cid:48) is also in the convex hull and

(cid:107)w(cid:107)2

(cid:107)w(cid:48)(cid:107)2 = (1 − α)2(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 + α2(cid:107)xi(cid:107)2 + 2α(1 − α)(cid:104)w, xi(cid:105)

1

(cid:107)w(cid:107)2/(cid:107)xi(cid:107)2 + 1

which leads to a contradiction.

We have thus shown that w is also an ERM. Finally, since w is in the convex
hull of the examples, we can apply Caratheodory’s theorem to obtain that w is
also in the convex hull of a subset of d + 1 points of the polygon. Furthermore,
the minimality of w implies that w must be on a face of the polygon and this
implies it can be represented as a convex combination of d points.

It remains to show that w is also the projection onto the polygon deﬁned by the
d points. But this must be true: On one hand, the smaller polygon is a subset of
the larger one; hence the projection onto the smaller cannot be smaller in norm.
On the other hand, w itself is a valid solution. The uniqueness of projection
concludes our proof.

30.2.3

Separating Polynomials
Let X = Rd and consider the class x (cid:55)→ sign(p(x)) where p is a degree r polyno-
mial.

1 It can be shown that w is the direction of the max-margin solution.

414

Compression Bounds

Note that p(x) can be rewritten as (cid:104)w, ψ(x)(cid:105) where the elements of ψ(x) are all
the monomials of x up to degree r. Therefore, the problem of constructing a com-
pression scheme for p(x) reduces to the problem of constructing a compression
scheme for halfspaces in Rd(cid:48)

where d(cid:48) = O(dr).

30.2.4

Separation with Margin

Suppose that a training set is separated with margin γ. The Perceptron algorithm
guarantees to make at most 1/γ2 updates before converging to a solution that
makes no mistakes on the entire training set. Hence, we have a compression
scheme of size k ≤ 1/γ2.

30.3

Bibliographic Remarks

Compression schemes and their relation to learning were introduced by Little-
stone & Warmuth (1986). As we have shown, if a class has a compression scheme
then it is learnable. For binary classiﬁcation problems, it follows from the funda-
mental theorem of learning that the class has a ﬁnite VC dimension. The other
direction, namely, whether every hypothesis class of ﬁnite VC dimension has a
compression scheme of ﬁnite size, is an open problem posed by Manfred War-
muth and is still open (see also (Floyd 1989, Floyd & Warmuth 1995, Ben-David
& Litman 1998, Livni & Simon 2013).

31 PAC-Bayes

31.1

The Minimum Description Length (MDL) and Occam’s razor principles allow a
potentially very large hypothesis class but deﬁne a hierarchy over hypotheses and
prefer to choose hypotheses that appear higher in the hierarchy. In this chapter
we describe the PAC-Bayesian approach that further generalizes this idea. In
the PAC-Bayesian approach, one expresses the prior knowledge by deﬁning prior
distribution over the hypothesis class.

PAC-Bayes Bounds
As in the MDL paradigm, we deﬁne a hierarchy over hypotheses in our class H.
Now, the hierarchy takes the form of a prior distribution over H. That is, we
assign a probability (or density if H is continuous) P (h) ≥ 0 for each h ∈ H
and refer to P (h) as the prior score of h. Following the Bayesian reasoning
approach, the output of the learning algorithm is not necessarily a single hy-
pothesis. Instead, the learning process deﬁnes a posterior probability over H,
which we denote by Q. In the context of a supervised learning problem, where
H contains functions from X to Y, one can think of Q as deﬁning a randomized
prediction rule as follows. Whenever we get a new instance x, we randomly pick
a hypothesis h ∈ H according to Q and predict h(x). We deﬁne the loss of Q on
an example z to be

(cid:96)(Q, z) def= E
h∼Q

[(cid:96)(h, z)].

By the linearity of expectation, the generalization loss and training loss of Q can
be written as

LD(Q) def= E
h∼Q

[LD(h)]

and LS(Q) def= E
h∼Q

[LS(h)].

The following theorem tells us that the diﬀerence between the generalization
loss and the empirical loss of a posterior Q is bounded by an expression that
depends on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between Q and the prior distribu-
tion P . The Kullback-Leibler is a natural measure of the distance between two
distributions. The theorem suggests that if we would like to minimize the gen-
eralization loss of Q, we should jointly minimize both the empirical loss of Q
and the Kullback-Leibler distance between Q and the prior distribution. We will

1− δ over the choice of an i.i.d. training set S = {z1, . . . , zm} sampled according
to D, for all distributions Q over H (even such that depend on S), we have

We now turn to bound ES[ef (S)]. The main trick is to upper bound f (S) by
using an expression that does not depend on Q but rather depends on the prior
probability P . To do so, ﬁx some S and note that from the deﬁnition of D(Q||P )
we get that for all Q,

Remark 31.1 (Regularization) The PAC-Bayes bound leads to the following
learning rule:

Given a prior P , return a posterior Q that minimizes the function

(31.7)

This rule is similar to the regularized risk minimization principle. That is, we
jointly minimize the empirical loss of Q on the sample and the Kullback-Leibler
“distance” between Q and P .

Appendix B Measure Concentration

(cid:80)m

Let Z1, . . . , Zm be an i.i.d. sequence of random variables and let µ be their mean.
The strong law of large numbers states that when m tends to inﬁnity, the em-
pirical average, 1
i=1 Zi, converges to the expected value µ, with probability
m
1. Measure concentration inequalities quantify the deviation of the empirical
average from the expectation when m is ﬁnite.

B.1

Markov’s Inequality

(cid:90) ∞

x=0

(cid:90) a

We start with an inequality which is called Markov’s inequality. Let Z be a
nonnegative random variable. The expectation of Z can be written as follows:

E[Z] =

P[Z ≥ x]dx.

(B.1)

(cid:90) a

Since P[Z ≥ x] is monotonically nonincreasing we obtain

∀a ≥ 0, E[Z] ≥

P[Z ≥ x]dx ≥

P[Z ≥ a]dx = a P[Z ≥ a].

(B.2)

Rearranging the inequality yields Markov’s inequality:

x=0

x=0

∀a ≥ 0, P[Z ≥ a] ≤ E[Z]

(B.3)

For random variables that take value in [0, 1], we can derive from Markov’s

inequality the following.

lemma B.1 Let Z be a random variable that takes values in [0, 1]. Assume that
E[Z] = µ. Then, for any a ∈ (0, 1),

P[Z > 1 − a] ≥ µ − (1 − a)

.

a

This also implies that for every a ∈ (0, 1),
P[Z > a] ≥ µ − a
1 − a

≥ µ − a.

Proof Let Y = 1 − Z. Then Y is a nonnegative random variable with E[Y ] =
1 − E[Z] = 1 − µ. Applying Markov’s inequality on Y we obtain

P[Z ≤ 1 − a] = P[1 − Z ≥ a] = P[Y ≥ a] ≤ E[Y ]

decreases polynomially with m. It is possible to obtain a signiﬁcantly faster

where the last inequality occurs because (1 − a) ≤ e−a. Setting λ = /6 (which
is in (0, 1/2) by our assumption) we obtain the second inequality stated in the
lemma.

Finally, the last inequality follows from the ﬁrst two inequalities and the union

bound.

Appendix C Linear Algebra

C.1

Basic Deﬁnitions

In this chapter we only deal with linear algebra over ﬁnite dimensional Euclidean
spaces. We refer to vectors as column vectors.

Given two d dimensional vectors u, v ∈ Rd, their inner product is

d(cid:88)

uivi.

(cid:104)u, v(cid:105) =

i=1

The Euclidean norm (a.k.a. the (cid:96)2 norm) is (cid:107)u(cid:107) =(cid:112)(cid:104)u, u(cid:105). We also use the (cid:96)1
norm, (cid:107)u(cid:107)1 =(cid:80)d

i=1 |ui| and the (cid:96)∞ norm (cid:107)u(cid:107)∞ = maxi |ui|.

A subspace of Rd is a subset of Rd which is closed under addition and scalar
multiplication. The span of a set of vectors u1, . . . , uk is the subspace containing
all vectors of the form

k(cid:88)

αiui

i=1

where for all i, αi ∈ R.

A set of vectors U = {u1, . . . , uk} is independent if for every i, ui is not in the
span of u1, . . . , ui−1, ui+1, . . . , uk. We say that U spans a subspace V if V is the
span of the vectors in U . We say that U is a basis of V if it is both independent
and spans V. The dimension of V is the size of a basis of V (and it can be veriﬁed
that all bases of V have the same size). We say that U is an orthogonal set if for
all i (cid:54)= j, (cid:104)ui, uj(cid:105) = 0. We say that U is an orthonormal set if it is orthogonal
and if for every i, (cid:107)ui(cid:107) = 1.
Given a matrix A ∈ Rn,d, the range of A is the span of its columns and the
null space of A is the subspace of all vectors that satisfy Au = 0. The rank of A
is the dimension of its range.

The transpose of a matrix A, denoted A(cid:62), is the matrix whose (i, j) entry

equals the (j, i) entry of A. We say that A is symmetric if A = A(cid:62).

C.2 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

431

C.2

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Let A ∈ Rd,d be a matrix. A non-zero vector u is an eigenvector of A with a
corresponding eigenvalue λ if

Au = λu.

ui is an eigenvector of A. Furthermore, A can be written as A =(cid:80)d

If A ∈ Rd,d is a symmetric matrix of
theorem C.1 (Spectral Decomposition)
rank k, then there exists an orthonormal basis of Rd, u1, . . . , ud, such that each
i=1 λiuiu(cid:62)
i ,
where each λi is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector ui. This can
be written equivalently as A = U DU(cid:62), where the columns of U are the vectors
u1, . . . , ud, and D is a diagonal matrix with Di,i = λi and for i (cid:54)= j, Di,j =
0. Finally, the number of λi which are nonzero is the rank of the matrix, the
eigenvectors which correspond to the nonzero eigenvalues span the range of A,
and the eigenvectors which correspond to zero eigenvalues span the null space of
A.

C.3

C.4

Positive deﬁnite matrices
A symmetric matrix A ∈ Rd,d is positive deﬁnite if all its eigenvalues are positive.
A is positive semideﬁnite if all its eigenvalues are nonnegative.
theorem C.2 Let A ∈ Rd,d be a symmetric matrix. Then, the following are
equivalent deﬁnitions of positive semideﬁniteness of A:
• All the eigenvalues of A are nonnegative.
• For every vector u, (cid:104)u, Au(cid:105) ≥ 0.
• There exists a matrix B such that A = BB(cid:62).

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Let A ∈ Rm,n be a matrix of rank r. When m (cid:54)= n, the eigenvalue decomposition
given in Theorem C.1 cannot be applied. We will describe another decomposition
of A, which is called Singular Value Decomposition, or SVD for short.

Unit vectors v ∈ Rn and u ∈ Rm are called right and left singular vectors of

A with corresponding singular value σ > 0 if

Av = σu and A(cid:62)u = σv.

We ﬁrst show that if we can ﬁnd r orthonormal singular vectors with positive
singular values, then we can decompose A = U DV (cid:62), with the columns of U and
V containing the left and right singular vectors, and D being a diagonal r × r
matrix with the singular values on its diagonal.

432

Linear Algebra

lemma C.3 Let A ∈ Rm,n be a matrix of rank r. Assume that v1, . . . , vr is an
orthonormal set of right singular vectors of A, u1, . . . , ur is an orthonormal set
of corresponding left singular vectors of A, and σ1, . . . , σr are the corresponding
singular values. Then,

r(cid:88)

A =

σiuiv(cid:62)
i .

It follows that if U is a matrix whose columns are the ui’s, V is a matrix whose
columns are the vi’s, and D is a diagonal matrix with Di,i = σi, then

i=1

A = U DV (cid:62).

adding the vectors vr+1, . . . , vn. Deﬁne B =(cid:80)r

Proof Any right singular vector of A must be in the range of A(cid:62) (otherwise,
the singular value will have to be zero). Therefore, v1, . . . , vr is an orthonormal
basis of the range of A. Let us complete it to an orthonormal basis of Rn by
i . It suﬃces to prove
that for all i, Avi = Bvi. Clearly, if i > r then Avi = 0 and Bvi = 0 as well.
For i ≤ r we have

i=1 σiuiv(cid:62)

r(cid:88)

Bvi =

σjujv(cid:62)

j vi = σiui = Avi,

j=1

where the last equality follows from the deﬁnition.

The next lemma relates the singular values of A to the eigenvalues of A(cid:62)A

and AA(cid:62).
lemma C.4 v, u are right and left singular vectors of A with singular value σ
iﬀ v is an eigenvector of A(cid:62)A with corresponding eigenvalue σ2 and u = σ−1Av
is an eigenvector of AA(cid:62) with corresponding eigenvalue σ2.
Proof Suppose that σ is a singular value of A with v ∈ Rn being the corre-
sponding right singular vector. Then,

Similarly,

A(cid:62)Av = σA(cid:62)u = σ2v.

AA(cid:62)u = σAv = σ2u.

For the other direction, if λ (cid:54)= 0 is an eigenvalue of A(cid:62)A, with v being the
corresponding eigenvector, then λ > 0 because A(cid:62)A is positive semideﬁnite. Let
σ =

λ, u = σ−1Av. Then,

C.4 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

433

Finally, we show that if A has rank r then it has r orthonormal singular

vectors.
lemma C.5 Let A ∈ Rm,n with rank r. Deﬁne the following vectors:

(cid:107)Av(cid:107)
(cid:107)Av(cid:107)

v1 = argmax

v∈Rn:(cid:107)v(cid:107)=1

v2 = argmax
(cid:104)v,v1(cid:105)=0

v∈Rn:(cid:107)v(cid:107)=1

...
vr =

(cid:107)Av(cid:107)

argmax

v∈Rn:(cid:107)v(cid:107)=1
∀i<r, (cid:104)v,vi(cid:105)=0

Then, v1, . . . , vr is an orthonormal set of right singular vectors of A.

Proof First note that since the rank of A is r, the range of A is a subspace of
dimension r, and therefore it is easy to verify that for all i = 1, . . . , r, (cid:107)Avi(cid:107) > 0.
Let W ∈ Rn,n be an orthonormal matrix obtained by the eigenvalue decompo-
sition of A(cid:62)A, namely, A(cid:62)A = W DW (cid:62), with D being a diagonal matrix with
D1,1 ≥ D2,2 ≥ ··· ≥ 0. We will show that v1, . . . , vr are eigenvectors of A(cid:62)A
that correspond to nonzero eigenvalues, and, hence, using Lemma C.4 it follows
that these are also right singular vectors of A. The proof is by induction. For the
basis of the induction, note that any unit vector v can be written as v = W x,
for x = W (cid:62)v, and note that (cid:107)x(cid:107) = 1. Therefore,

(cid:107)Av(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)AW x(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)W DW (cid:62)W x(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)W Dx(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)Dx(cid:107)2 =

D2

i,ixi

2.

Therefore,

max
v:(cid:107)v(cid:107)=1

(cid:107)Av(cid:107)2 = max
x:(cid:107)x(cid:107)=1

i=1

n(cid:88)

i=1

D2

i,ixi

2.

n(cid:88)

The solution of the right-hand side is to set x = (1, 0, . . . , 0), which implies that
v1 is the ﬁrst eigenvector of A(cid:62)A. Since (cid:107)Av1(cid:107) > 0 it follows that D1,1 > 0 as
required. For the induction step, assume that the claim holds for some 1 ≤ t ≤
r − 1. Then, any v which is orthogonal to v1, . . . , vt can be written as v = W x
with all the ﬁrst t elements of x being zero. It follows that

max

v:(cid:107)v(cid:107)=1,∀i≤t,v(cid:62)vi=0

(cid:107)Av(cid:107)2 = max
x:(cid:107)x(cid:107)=1

D2

i,ixi

2.

n(cid:88)

i=t+1

The solution of the right-hand side is the all zeros vector except xt+1 = 1. This
implies that vt+1 is the (t + 1)th column of W . Finally, since (cid:107)Avt+1(cid:107) > 0 it
follows that Dt+1,t+1 > 0 as required. This concludes our proof.

434

Linear Algebra

corollary C.6 (The SVD theorem) Let A ∈ Rm,n with rank r. Then A =
U DV (cid:62) where D is an r × r matrix with nonzero singular values of A and the
columns of U, V are orthonormal left and right singular vectors of A. Further-
i,i is an eigenvalue of A(cid:62)A, the ith column of V is the cor-
more, for all i, D2
responding eigenvector of A(cid:62)A and the ith column of U is the corresponding
eigenvector of AA(cid:62).
